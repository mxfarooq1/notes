Speaker: Eshwarjyot Singh

- Practice quote: Bleed in practice, so don't have to bleed in war
- Step 0:
	- questions to ask - to give control in your hand: 
		- howz family?
		- when do you come to the country?
		- where did you study?
		- college and course?
		- where do you work?
		- Full time or part time?

- always put the income in range while explaining

- Points to use for hiring recruits
	- WFH (meet in convention) / sometimes in-person if in province
	- Time / flex - 15-20 hours
	- system to train + govt license
	- earn $3000-4000

2 types of income:
	- single handed income
		- no security, you dont control employment, somebody else do
		- limited - cap on it - 15/hour or 3000/month income
		- no freedom - example: get a day off n get it approved
		- hour based
	- multi handed income
		- security 
		- unlimited
		- freedom
		- system based

Step 1:
- 3 types of industries we work with tat combines a financial industry:
	- Debt
		- Debt, 
		- Mortgage - 50-60% paycheck goes here
		- refi
	- Insurance
		- All types
	- Investment industry
		- TFSA, RRSP, RESP, LIRA, LIF, RRIF, FHSA

Question to ask: would you put your money without financial education?

We charge $0 to the client !!

Average person
- 1/4 - tax
	- will train you to put some of this in saving
- 1/4 - debt
- 1/2 - living expense

Need
- According to Stats Canada 91% of Canadians are financially broke
- WFG will help you get in to 9%

Ask ppl, if they want
- Make more money
- Save more money
- Both - most ppl will say

Concerns:
- Investment required in Canada:
	- $150 plus tax (covers : registration, criminal check, soft background check - bankruptcy, website)
	- $300 - course fees
	- $340
	- $19 - PCC
	- Total = $600-$650 
- Need
- Knowledge
- Time
- Risk
	- either you will earn or learn !!
	- 1 client will make you $1200 / month


Where lot of people are investing hundred/thousand of dollar in same kind of money, would it make sense to invest in this kind of business?
