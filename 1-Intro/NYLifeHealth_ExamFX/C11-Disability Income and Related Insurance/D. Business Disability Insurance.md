Just as an individual purchases disability income insurance to protect their ability to earn a living, a business purchases **business disability insurance** on its key employees to protect it from loss when the employee becomes disabled.

### 1. Key Person Disability Income

**Key person disability** is purchased by the employer on the life of a key employee. The key person's economic value to the business is determined in terms of the potential loss of business income which could occur as well as the expense of hiring and training a replacement for the key person. **The contract is owned by the business, the premium is paid by the business, and the business is the beneficiary.** The person is the insured, and the business must have the key person's consent to be insured in writing. 

Know This

In key person disability insurance, the business is the contract owner, premium payor, and the beneficiary.

### 2. Disability Buy-sell Policy

A **buy-sell agreement** is a legal agreement prepared by an attorney. The buy-sell agreement specifies how the business will pass between owners when one of the owners dies or becomes disabled. It is common for the business to purchase insurance to provide the cash to accomplish the buyout when the owner either dies or becomes disabled. The policies that fund buy-sell agreements generally have an extremely long elimination period, possibly one or two years. Generally, these policies funding buy-sell agreements also provide a large lump-sum benefit to buy out the business rather than monthly benefits.

### 3. Business Overhead Expense Policy

**Business overhead expense (BOE)** insurance is a unique type of policy that is sold to small business owners who must continue to meet overhead expenses, such as rent, utilities, employee salaries, installment purchases, or leased equipment, following a disability. The business overhead expense policy reimburses the business owner for the actual overhead expenses that are incurred while the business owner is totally disabled. This policy does not reimburse the business owner for their salary, compensation, or other form of income that is lost as a result of disability. There is usually an elimination period of 15 to 30 days and benefit payments are usually limited to one or two years. The benefits are usually limited to covered expenses incurred or the maximum monthly benefit stated in the policy. The premiums paid for BOE insurance are tax deductible to the business as a business expense. However, the benefits received are taxable to the business as received.
