One major risk that individuals face in their lifetime is the possibility that they will become totally disabled and be unable to perform work duties for a period of time. Recent statistics show that there is a 30% chance of a 25-year-old being disabled for more than 90 days prior to age 65. It is far less likely that the same 25-year-old will suffer a premature death prior to age 65.

For most people who are unable to go to work, employment income would terminate after a brief period of time. Consequently, most people would be forced to turn to personal savings to pay normal living expenses such as food, rent and utilities. A question to ask is how long a person can survive without any income.

**Disability income insurance** is designed to replace lost income in the event of this contingency, and is a vital component of a comprehensive insurance program. It may be purchased individually or through an employer on a group basis.

Disability income benefits are limited to a percentage of earned income. The insurer wants a claimant to have a financial incentive to return to work. A person becomes eligible for regular disability benefits when they meet the insurance company's definition of disability due to either a sickness or an injury. This definition of disability does vary from company to company. It is important for the applicant and the producer to be fully aware of this important benefit trigger.

### 1. Inability to Perform Duties

To pay benefits, a disability income policy will require for the insured to not be able to perform the duties of their occupation. The benefits will also depend on the definition of disability chosen for the policy. 

#### Own Occupation

An _own occupation_ policy will provide benefits when the insured is unable to perform any duties of their own occupation because of sickness or accident.

This definition is usually limited to the first 24 months after a loss. It allows insureds (claimants) to receive benefits if, because of disablement, they cannot perform the duties of their normal occupation even though they might be able to earn income from a different occupation. After 24 months, if the insured is still unable to perform the duties of their own occupation, the definition of disability narrows to mean the inability to perform **any occupation** for which the insured is reasonably suited by education, training, or experience. This is a dramatic reduction in the insurer's liability because it is very likely that claimants can find something they can do for financial gain. The “own occ” definition is generally used for highly trained, skilled occupations such as surgeons, trial attorneys, etc.

#### Any Occupation

A policy that has an "any occupation" provision will only provide benefits when the insured is unable to perform any of the duties of the occupation for which they are suited by reason of education, training, or experience. "Own occupation" is the more liberal definition and therefore provides a better benefit for the insured.

Although some companies still utilize the two-tier approach by combining both definitions in a single disability income policy, from an underwriting standpoint, it is much easier for an insurance company to justify the "any occupation" definition when agreeing to issue a policy.

Know This

Considering a disabled insured is able to perform some duties of the occupation, coverage under the "any occupation" policy is more likely to be denied than under the "own occupation" policy.

### 2. Presumptive Disability

**Presumptive disability** is a provision that is found in most disability income policies which specifies the conditions that will automatically qualify the insured for full disability benefits. Some disability policies provide a benefit when people simply meet certain qualifications, regardless of their ability to work. The presumptive disability provision provides a benefit for dismemberment:

- The loss of use of any **two limbs**;
- Total and permanent **blindness**; or 
- Loss of **speech or hearing**.  
    

Some policies require actual severance of limbs rather than loss of use.

### 3. Proof of Loss

All life insurance or annuity contracts that provide disability benefits, including waiver of premium, must include a **proof of loss** provision. Contracts must establish when and how the insured must prove the disability. They must also allow for regular examinations of the insured by the insurer.

The claim will not be invalidated or reduced if it is impossible for the insured to produce proof of disability within the time frame, provided such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible.

Except in the absence of legal capacity, proof of loss must be provided **no later than 1 year** of the time proof would otherwise be required.
