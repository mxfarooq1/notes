An **individual disability income** policy is applied for and paid for by the individual rather than through the employer as for group disability income. Individual Disability Income premiums are paid with after-tax dollars, and benefits are not income taxable.

### 1. Basic Total Disability Plan

A **total disability** plan protects the family or an individual against the economic loss that comes with the total disability of the wage earner.

#### Income Benefits (Monthly Indemnity)

Most often, benefits are paid monthly, but could be paid weekly in some policies. The amount of the benefit is stated in the policy and is usually limited to a percentage of one’s income at the time of application to prevent overinsurance.

#### Elimination and Benefit Periods

**Elimination period** is a waiting period that is imposed on the insured from the onset of disability until benefit payments commence. It is a _deductible measured in days, instead of dollars_. The purpose of the elimination period is to eliminate coverage for short-term disabilities in which the insured will be able to return to work in a relatively short period of time. The elimination periods found in most policies range from 30 days to 180 days. Just as a higher deductible amount results in lower premiums for medical expense insurance, a longer elimination period translates into a lower premium for disability income insurance. An important consideration in selecting the elimination period is that payments are made in arrears. Therefore, if the insured selects a 90-day elimination period, the insured will be eligible for benefits on the 91st day, but payments will not begin until the 121st day. The insured must determine how long the insured can go without benefit payments following disability in selecting the duration of the elimination period.

Know This

The elimination period is a "time" deductible, designed to eliminate coverage for short-term disabilities, and reduce the filing of excessive claims.

**Benefit period** refers to the length of time over which the monthly disability benefit payments will last for each disability after the elimination period has been satisfied. Most policies offer benefit periods of 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and to age 65. Some plans offer lifetime benefits. The longer the benefit period, the higher the premium will be.

**Injury** is defined using either the accidental bodily injury definition, or the accidental means definition. _Accidental bodily injury_ means the damage to the body is unexpected and unintended. _Accidental means_ indicates that the cause of the accident must be unexpected and unintended. A policy that uses the accidental bodily injury definition will provide broader coverage than a policy that uses the accidental means definition.

**Sickness** or illness is defined as either a sickness or disease contracted after the policy has been in force at least 30 days; or a sickness or disease that first manifests itself after the policy is in force.

Often, the insurance company will allow the insured to have different benefit periods for injury and sickness. _For example,_ the insured could apply for benefit periods of 5 years for sickness, but to age 65 for accident.

**Recurrent disability** is generally expressed in a policy provision that specifies the period of time (usually within 3-6 months), during which the recurrence of an injury or illness will be considered as a continuation of a prior period of disability. The significance of this feature is that recurrence of a disabling condition will not be considered to be a new period of disability so that the insured is not subjected to another elimination period.

#### Waiver of Premium Feature

**Waiver of premium** is usually included in a basic disability income policy. This benefit allows the insured, when disabled, to forego paying the premiums once the insured qualifies for benefits. Premiums that were paid by the insured during the elimination period are usually refunded once the insured qualifies to begin receiving benefits.

### 2. Coordination of Benefits

The purpose of the coordination of benefits (COB) provision, found only in group health plans, is to avoid duplication of benefit payments and overinsurance when an individual is covered under multiple group health insurance plans. This provision limits the total amount of claims paid from all insurers covering the patient to no more than the total allowable medical expenses.

The COB provision establishes which plan is the **primary** plan, or the plan that is responsible for providing the full benefit amounts as it specifies. Once the primary plan has paid its full promised benefit, the insured submits the claim to the **secondary**, or **excess**, provider for any additional benefits payable (including deductibles and coinsurance). In no case will the total amount the insured receives exceed the costs incurred or the total maximum benefits available under all plans.

**Loss - Amount covered by Primary Plan = Amount covered by Secondary Plan**

If all policies have a COB provision, the order of payments is determined as follows:

- If a married couple both have group coverage in which they are each named as dependents on the other's policy, then the person’s own group coverage will be considered **primary**. The **secondary** coverage (the spouses' coverage) will pick up where the first policy left off.
- If both parents name their children as dependents under their group policies, then the order of payment will usually be determined by the **birthday rule**, i.e., the coverage of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year will be considered primary. Occasionally, the **gender rule** may also apply, according to which the father's coverage is considered primary.
- If the parents are divorced or separated, the policy of the parent who has custody of the children will be considered primary.

Know This

Coordination of benefits provision ensures that benefits are not paid in excess of the total losses incurred.

### 3. Individual Premium Consideration and Coordination with Social Insurance

**Premium payments** on personally owned disability income policies are **nondeductible** by the individual. However, disability **income benefits** are received **income tax free** by the individual.

In order to avoid overinsurance, insurance companies have several options to work with Social Security benefits.

#### Additional Monthly Benefit (AMB)

Some insurance companies offer the **Additional Monthly Benefit** rider for  approximately the same amount as what the Social Security would pay. The benefit only is provided for one year. It is then anticipated that Social Security benefits would commence at the end of one year.

#### Social Insurance Supplement (SIS)

The insurance company may offer a **Social Insurance Supplement rider** (note: this is a rider, and not a separate plan), which will pay a benefit in the approximate amount that Social Security would pay, but if Social Security does in fact pay, the Social Insurance Supplement benefit is reduced dollar for dollar by the Social Security benefit payment.

Social Insurance Supplement (SIS) riders are used to supplement or replace benefits that might be payable under Social Security Disability. These provide for the payment of income benefits generally in 3 different situations:

1. When the insured is eligible for Social Security benefits but before the benefits begin (There is usually a 5-month waiting period for Social Security benefits, with the payment of benefits beginning on the 6th month);
2. If the insured has been denied coverage under Social Security (Roughly 75% of the people who apply for Social Security benefits are denied coverage because of their rigid definition of "total disability"); or
3. When the amount payable under Social Security is less than the amount payable under the rider. (In this case, only the difference will be paid.)

These riders can also be used to replace or supplement benefits payable under other social insurance programs, such as Workers Compensation.

#### Occupational vs. Nonoccupational Coverage

Health insurance, including disability insurance, can be written on an **occupational** or a **nonoccupational** basis. _Occupational_ coverage provides benefits for illness, injury or disability resulting from accidents or sicknesses that occur _on or off_ the job. _Nonoccupational_ coverage, on the other hand, only covers claims that result from accidents or sicknesses occurring _off_ the job. While many individual health policies are written on an occupational or nonoccupational basis, most group plans are nonoccupational only. It is assumed that accidents or injuries occurring on the job will be covered by Workers Compensation coverage.

Know This

Policies written on an occupational basis cover accidents or sicknesses that occur on or off the job. When written on a nonoccupational basis, policies cover claims that result solely from accidents or sicknesses occurring off the job.

#### Cancellation and Renewability

The insurer has the right to **cancel** an individual accident and health policy within the first **90 days** after its issue, as long as the insurer provides a 10-day notice to the insured. The insurer must return any unearned premium on a pro-rata basis.

Typically, disability income policies are **renewable** until the insured’s age 65. The continuation of coverage rider provides that the insured can renew the policy after age 65 as long as they are actively and gainfully working full-time.

### 4. Other Provisions Affecting Income Benefits

Insurance companies offer other riders, which can affect the income benefit in the disability income policy.

#### Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) Rider

The purchasing power of disability benefits can be eroded by inflation. The **cost of living adjustment (COLA) rider** will help protect against inflation. Under this rider, the insured’s monthly benefit will be increased automatically, once claim payments have begun. Generally, the first increase would be at the end of one year to be followed by annual increases for as long as the insured remains on the claim. Some of these riders provide for compound interest adjustments while others provide simple interest adjustments.

#### Future Increase Option (FIO) Rider

**Guaranteed Insurability Rider**, also referred to as the _Future Increase Option_, allows an insured to increase the benefit level to a specific predetermined amount at certain times or on certain occasions _without proof of insurability_. The times when the benefit may be increased are generally at ages 25, 28, 31, 34, 37 and 40. An increase may also be taken at one’s marriage or the birth of a child. In order to exercise this rider, the insured must qualify from an income standpoint to prevent overinsurance. 

#### Relation of Earnings to Insurance

The danger of being over-insured is always a potential risk with health insurance coverage, but this is especially true regarding disability income. The concept of indemnity must be protected.

All disability income insurers use the Relation of Earnings to Insurance rule which allows the insurer to check the income of the insured for a specified period of time prior to the submission of an income claim. There will be a percentage cap that the insurer will enforce.

A disability income insurer does not want a situation where there is no incentive for an insured to seek rehabilitation because that insured is receiving a greater income while disabled than while working.

This is also why if an insured is covered by multiple policies, insurers are liable for only a proportionate amount of the disability benefits the insured will receive. This is figured by comparing the amount a single insurer will pay with the amount that would be paid by all insurers. However, the total monthly benefits cannot drop below the lesser of $200 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in coverage.

### 5. Benefits

#### Accidental Death and Dismemberment

A disability policy may contain an Accidental Death and Dismemberment rider which pays for accidental losses only, and is thus considered a pure form of accident insurance. The **principal sum** is paid for accidental death or loss of both hands, both feet, or both eyes. This amount is usually equal the amount of coverage under the insurance contract, or the face amount. In case of accidental dismemberment (loss of one hand or one foot) or loss of sight in one eye, a **percentage** of that principal sum will be paid by the policy, also referred to as the **capital sum**. The amount of the benefit will vary according to the severity of the injury.

_For example_, the policy will usually pay the full principal for the loss of sight in both eyes, or two or more limbs; however, it may only pay 50% for the loss of one hand or one foot. In addition, some policies will pay double or triple indemnity, meaning the policy will pay twice or three times the face amount in the event of accidental death. Most policies will pay the accidental death benefit as long as the death is caused by the accident and occurs within a specific time, such as 60-90 days.

Know This

Principal sum = maximum payment for accidental death; capital sum = percentage of principal sum for accidental injury.

#### Rehabilitation Benefit

If the insured has been totally disabled, it is possible that rehabilitation will be necessary to help get the insured back to work, either in their old occupation or in another occupation. The rehabilitation benefit will cover a portion of the cost for the insured to enroll in a formal retraining program that will help the insured to return to work. This benefit usually offers a specified sum (several times of the monthly indemnity) to cover costs not paid by other insurance.

#### Medical Reimbursement Benefit (Nondisabling Injury)

This benefit provides for the payment of medical expenses incurred due to an accidental bodily injury when the insured is not disabled.

#### Partial Disability Benefit

**Partial disability** is often defined as the inability to perform one or more of the regular duties of one’s own occupation or the inability to work on a full-time basis, which results in a decrease in the individual's income. The purpose of the partial disability benefit is to cover a partial loss of income when the insured is disabled to the point of being able to report to work, but not being able to perform all of the regular duties of the job. The **partial disability benefit** is typically 50% of the total disability benefit, and is limited to a certain period of time, as noted in the policy.

The benefits paid on a partial disability policy are paid in a flat amount, or a residual amount.

Know This

Partial disability covers a partial loss of income for disabled insureds who are unable to perform some, but not all, of their regular job duties.

#### Residual Disability Benefit

The residual disability benefit is a coverage provided by the disability income policy. In some cases, it is an automatic coverage. In other cases, it must be added to the policy as a rider. It concerns an insured who can only come back to work on a part time basis and provides a guaranteed dollar amount. For example, Carl earns $4,000 per month. His disability income policy guarantees $3,400 per month for a covered disability. Carl recovers partially and can only work 20 days per month which forces his employer to reduce his monthly income to $2,800. Therefore, the residual disability coverage would pay Carl the difference, or $600 per month for the full benefit period.

#### Total Disability Benefit

In order for an insured to qualify for this benefit, the insured must meet the policy’s definition of **total disability**. Although this definition will differ from one policy to another, it is generally defined as the inability to engage in any work. More specifically, total disability refers to the insured's inability to perform the duties of their own occupation for the first 2 years; then any gainful employment for which the insured is reasonably suited by education, training and experience. No benefits are payable for partial disability.

### 6. 24-Hour Coverage vs. Limited or At-Work Coverage

The concept of **24-hour coverage** means that an employee is provided with both a workers compensation policy and some type of medical insurance coverage such as a disability insurance policy or health care service plan for injuries or illnesses that occur outside of work. The employee is covered 24 hours a day (while at work under the Workers Compensation plan and outside of work under the medical insurance plan). This type of coverage may not be distributed using a life insurance policy.

### 7. Exclusions

Generally, disability income policies do not cover losses arising from war, military service, intentionally self-inflicted injuries, overseas residence, or injuries suffered while committing or attempting to commit a felony.
