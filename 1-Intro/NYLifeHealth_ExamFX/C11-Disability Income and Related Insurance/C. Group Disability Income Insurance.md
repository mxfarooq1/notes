Disability income insurance is not only available in individual policies but also in group benefit packages provided by employers. Disability benefit payments that are attributed to employee contributions are not taxable, but benefits payments that are attributed to employer contributions are taxable to the employee. The premium is deductible to the employer.

### 1. Group vs. Individual Plans

Group plans differ from individual plans in a variety of ways. Listed below are the most common differences between group and individual disability plans:

- _Group plans_ usually specify the benefits based on a percentage of the worker’s income, while _individual policies_ usually specify a flat amount.
    
- _Short-term group plans_ usually provide maximum benefit periods of 13 to 52 weeks (with 26 weeks being the most common), with weekly benefits of 50% to 100% of the individual’s income. _Individual short-term plans_ have maximum benefit periods of 6 months to 2 years. Short-term plans are not renewable.
    
- _Group long-term plans_ provide maximum benefit periods of more than 2 years, with monthly benefits usually limited to 60% of the individual’s income.
    
- _Group disability plans_ also have minimum participation requirements. Usually, the employee must have worked for 30 to 90 days before becoming eligible for coverage.
    
- _Group plans_ usually make benefits supplemental to any benefits received under workers compensation.
    
- Some _group disability_ plans limit coverage to only nonoccupational disabilities.
    

Know This

Group disability plan benefits are based on a percentage of the worker’s income; individual policies specify a flat amount.

### 2. Short Term Disability (STD)

It is not uncommon for an employer to provide **short-term disability** benefits for all of the company’s employees. The elimination period could be as short as 0 days and the benefit period not longer than 2 years, but the benefit period could be 6 months or 1 year.

### 3. Long Term Disability (LTD)

Group **long-term disability** plans are often reserved for management employees. The elimination period will usually coincide with the benefit period of the short-term disability plan. The benefit period may be to age 65. Lower-wage employees are usually limited to 66 and 2/3 % of monthly wage, while higher-wage employees are limited to 50% of monthly wage.
