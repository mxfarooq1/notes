In contrast to individual life insurance, which is written on a single life, and in which the rate and coverage is based upon the underwriting of that individual, **group** **life insurance** is issued to the sponsoring organization, and covers the lives of **more than one individual** member of that group. Group insurance is usually written for employee-employer groups, but other types of groups are also eligible for coverage. It is usually written as **annually renewable term** insurance. Two features that distinguish group insurance from individual insurance are

- Evidence of insurability is usually not required (unless an applicant is enrolling for coverage outside the normal enrollment period); and
- Participants (insureds) under the plan do not receive a policy because they do not own or control the policy.

Instead, each insured participant under the group plan is issued a **certificate of insurance** evidencing that they have coverage. The actual policy, or **master policy/contract**, is issued to the sponsor of the group, which is often an employer. The group sponsor is the policyholder and is the one that exercises control over the policy.

Group insurance is written as annually renewable term insurance.   In group insurance, the master contract is for the employer, and certificates of insurance are for individual insureds.

### 1. Characteristics of Group Plans

Group underwriting differs from that of individual insurance, and is based on the group characteristics and makeup. Some of the characteristics of concern to a group underwriter include the following:

- **Purpose or nature of the group** — The group must be created for a purpose other than to obtain group insurance.
- **Size of the group** — The larger the number of people in the group, the more accurate the projections of future loss experience will be. This is based on the Law of Large Numbers of similar risks.
- **Turnover of the group** — From the underwriting perspective, a group should have a steady turnover: younger, lower-risk employees enter the group, and older, higher-risk employees leave.
- **Financial strength of the group** — Because group insurance is costly to administer, the underwriter should consider whether or not the group has the financial resources to pay the policy premiums, and whether or not it will be able to renew the coverage.

Another unique aspect of group underwriting is that the cost of the coverage is based on the average age of the group and the ratio of men to women. In addition, in order to reduce adverse selection, the insurer will require a minimum number of participants in the group, depending on whether the employer or employees pay the premium.

### 2. Types of Plan Sponsors

Group life insurance plans may be sponsored by employers, debtor groups, labor unions, credit unions, associations, and other organizations formed for a reason other than purchasing insurance. Insurance companies may establish a required minimum number of persons to be insured under a group plan.

### 3. Group Underwriting Requirements

Group life insurance is underwritten on a group basis as opposed to an individual basis. Each participant completes a short application that clearly identifies the insured and the insured’s beneficiary. Generally, if the group is large enough, there are **no medical questions** since the plan will be issued based upon the nature of the group and the group’s past claims experience.

### 4. Conversion to Individual Policy

Another characteristic of group insurance is the conversion privilege. If an employee terminates membership in the insured group, the employee has the right to convert to an individual policy **_without proving insurability_** at a standard rate, based on the individual's attained age. The group life policy can convert to any form of insurance issued by the insurer (usually whole life), _except_ for term insurance. The face amount or death benefit will be equal to the group term face amount, but the premium will be higher. The employee usually has a period of **31 days** **after terminating** from the group in order to exercise the conversion option. During this time, the employee is still covered under the original group policy.

Other rules that apply to conversion involve the death or disability of the insured, and termination of the master policy. If the **insured dies during the conversion period**, a death benefit equal to the maximum amount of individual insurance which would have been issued must be **paid by the group policy**, whether or not the application for an individual policy was completed. If the master contract is terminated, every individual who has been on the plan for at least **5 years** will be allowed to convert to individual permanent insurance of the same coverage.

When converting from group life to individual life insurance, evidence of insurability is not required.
