There are several other types of whole life policies. While they all have the same key characteristics, they may also offer unique features based on how the policyowner pays the premium or how the premium is invested. Flexible premium policies allow the policyowner to pay more or less than the planned premium.

### 1. Universal Life

**Universal life** insurance is also known by the generic name of _flexible premium adjustable life_. That implies that the policyowner has the flexibility to increase the amount of premium paid into the policy and to later decrease it again. In fact, the policyowner may even skip paying a premium and the policy will not lapse as long as there is sufficient cash value at the time to cover the monthly deductions for cost of insurance. If the cash value is too small, the policy will expire.

Since the premium can be adjusted, the insurance companies may give the policyowner a choice to pay either of the two types of premiums:

- The **minimum premium** is the amount needed to keep the policy in force for the current year. Paying the minimum premium will make the policy perform as an annually renewable term product.
- The **target premium** is a recommended amount that should be paid on a policy in order to cover the cost of insurance protection and to keep the policy in force throughout its lifetime.

Know This

If an insured skips a premium payment on a universal life policy, the missing premium may be deducted from the policy’s cash value. The policy will NOT lapse.

As well as being a flexible premium policy, universal life is also an interest-sensitive policy. Although the insurer guarantees a **contract interest rate** (usually 3 to 6%), there is also potential for the policyowner to get a **current interest rate**, which is not guaranteed in the contract but may be higher because of current market conditions.

A universal life policy has two components: an **insurance component** and a **cash account**. The insurance component of a universal life policy is always **annually renewable term insurance**.

Universal life offers one of two death benefit options to the policyowner. **Option A** is the _level death benefit_ option, and **Option B** is the _increasing death benefit_ option.

Under **Option A (Level Death Benefit option)**, the death benefit remains level while the cash value gradually increases, thereby lowering the _pure insurance_ with the insurer in the later years. Notice that the pure insurance is actually decreasing as time passes, lowering the expenses, and allowing for greater cash value in the older years. The reason that the illustration shows an increase in the death benefit at a later point in time is so that the policy will comply with the "statutory definition of life insurance" that was established by the IRS and applies to all life insurance contracts issued after December 31, 1984. According to this definition, there must be a specified "corridor" or gap maintained between the cash value and the death benefit in a life insurance policy. The percentages that apply to the corridor are established in a table published by the IRS and vary as to the age of the insured and the amount of coverage. If this corridor is not maintained, the policy is no longer defined as life insurance for tax purposes and consequently loses most of the tax advantages that have been associated with life insurance.

Under **Option B (Increasing Death Benefit option)**, the death benefit includes the annual increase in cash value so that the death benefit gradually increases each year by the amount that the cash value increases. At any point in time, the total death benefit will always be equal to the face amount of the policy plus the current amount of cash value. Since the _pure insurance_ with the insurer remains level for life, the expenses of this option are much greater than those for Option A, thereby causing the cash value to be lower in the older years (all else being equal).
