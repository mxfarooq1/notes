**Credit** insurance is a special type of coverage written to insure the life of the debtor and pay off the balance of a loan in the event of the death of the debtor. Credit life is usually written as **decreasing term insurance**, and it may be written as an individual policy or as a group plan. When written as a group policy, the creditor is the owner of the master policy, and each debtor receives a certificate of insurance.

**The creditor is the owner and the beneficiary of the policy** although the premiums are generally paid by the borrower (or the debtor). **Credit life insurance cannot pay out more than the balance of the debt**, so that there is no financial incentive for the death of the insured. The creditors may require the debtor to have life insurance; they cannot, however, require that the debtor buys insurance from a specific insurer.
