**Fixed** life insurance or annuities are contracts that offer guaranteed minimum or fixed benefits that are stated in the contract. **Variable** life insurance or annuities are contracts in which the cash values accumulate based upon a specific portfolio of stocks without guarantees of performance. Variable annuities keep pace with inflation, and are determined by the value of securities backing it.

**Variable life** insurance (sometimes referred to as _variable whole life insurance_) is a level, fixed premium, investment-based product. Like traditional forms of life insurance, these policies have fixed premiums and a guaranteed minimum death benefit. The cash value of the policy, however, is not guaranteed and fluctuates with the performance of the portfolio in which the premiums have been invested by the insurer. The policyowner bears the investment risk in variable contracts.

Know This

In variable contracts, the policyowner bears the investment risk (assets in a separate account).

Because the insurance company is not sustaining the investment risk of the contract, the underlying assets of the contract cannot be kept in the insurance company’s general account. These assets must be held in a **separate account**, which invests in stocks, bonds, and other securities investment options. Any domestic insurer issuing variable contracts must establish one or more separate accounts. Each separate account must maintain assets with a value at least equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities. Assets in the separate account cannot be commingled with assets in the general account.

### 1. Regulation of Variable Products (SEC, FINRA and New York)

Variable life insurance products are **dually regulated** by the State and Federal Government. Due to the element of investment risk, the federal government has declared that variable contracts are **securities**, and are thus regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Variable life insurance is also regulated by the Insurance Department as an insurance product.

**Agents** selling variable life insurance products must:

- Be registered with FINRA;
- Be licensed by the state to sell life insurance; and
- Have received a securities license.

The Superintendent has the sole authority to regulate the issuance and sale of variable contracts and to issue related rules and regulations.
