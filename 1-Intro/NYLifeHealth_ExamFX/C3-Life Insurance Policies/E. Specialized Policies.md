### 1. Joint Life (First-to-die)

**Joint life** is a single policy that is designed to insure two or more lives. Joint life policies can be in the form of term insurance or permanent insurance. The premium for joint life would be less than for the same type and amount of coverage on the same individuals. It is more commonly found as _joint whole life_, which functions similarly to an individual whole life policy with two major exceptions:

- The premium is based on a **joint average age** that is between the ages of the insureds; and
    
- The death benefit is paid upon the **first death only**.
    

A premium based on joint age is less than the sum of 2 premiums based on individual age, so it is common to find joint life policies issued on spouses. This is particularly so if the need for insurance is such that it does not extend beyond the first death. Joint life policies are used when there is a need for two or more persons to be protected; however, the need for the insurance is no longer present after the first of the insureds dies.

_For example_, a married couple purchasing a house may use a Joint Life policy for mortgage protection if both spouses work and earn close to the same amount of income. If one spouse dies, the insurance pays the mortgage for the surviving spouse.

Joint Life is also used to insure the lives of business partners in the funding of a buy-sell agreement and other business life needs. A buy-sell is a business continuation agreement that determines what will be done with the business in the event that an owner dies or becomes disabled.

Premium rates on a joint life policy are determined by averaging the ages of both insureds.

### 2. Survivorship Life (Second-to-die)

**Survivorship life** (also referred to as "second-to-die" or "last survivor" policy) is much the same as joint life in that it insures two or more lives for a **premium that is based on a joint age**. The major difference is that survivorship life **pays on the last death** rather than upon the first death. Since the death benefit is not paid until the last death, the joint life expectancy in a sense is extended, resulting in a lower premium than that which is typically charged for joint life, which pays upon the first death. This type of policy is often used to **offset the liability of the estate tax** upon the death of the last insured.

Know This

Joint life = first to die; survivorship life = second to die (last survivor).

### 3. Life Insurance for Minors

New York insurance law deems a minor at or above the age of **14½** competent to contract for, own, and exercise all rights relating to a life insurance policy. Minors below 14½ are prohibited from owning life insurance policies. The beneficiary of the policy may be only the minor or the parent, spouse, brother, sister, child or grandparent of the minor.  

A policy on a minor under **14½** may not be in excess of $50,000, or 50% of the amount of life insurance in force upon the life of the person effectuating the insurance at the date of issue, whichever limit is the greater. If the person who owns the policy on the minor reduces the amount of insurance on his own life, the amount on the minor will still be considered acceptable. In the case of a child under **4½,** the limit is $50,000 or 25% of the amount on the life of the owner of the policy. Any amount over the limit will not be paid as long as the minor is under 14½.

The policy on the life of a minor under 14½ may exceed the limits stated above for the following reasons:

- If the policy is purchased by and the premiums are paid by a person having an insurable interest in the life of the minor, **and**
    
- If the minor is not dependent upon the owner of the policy for support and maintenance.
