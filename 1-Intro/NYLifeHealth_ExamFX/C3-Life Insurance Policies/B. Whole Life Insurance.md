**Permanent** life insurance is a general term used to refer to various forms of life insurance policies that build cash value and remain in effect for the entire life of the insured (or until age 100) as long as the premium is paid. The most common type of permanent insurance is whole life.

**Whole life insurance** provides lifetime protection, and includes a savings element (or cash value). Whole life policies endow at the insured's **age 100**, which means the cash value created by the accumulation of premium is scheduled to equal the face amount of the policy at age 100. The policy premium is calculated assuming that the policyowner will be paying the premium until that age. Premiums for whole life policies usually are higher than for term insurance.

The following are key characteristics of whole life insurance.

- **Level premium —** the premium for whole life policies is based on the issue age; therefore, it remains the same throughout the life of the policy.
- **Death benefit —** the death benefit is guaranteed and also remains level for life.
- **Cash value —** the cash value, created by the accumulation of premium, is scheduled to equal the face amount of the policy when the insured reaches age 100 (the policy maturity date), and is paid out to the policyowner. (Remember: the insured and the policyowner do not have to be the same person.) Cash values are credited to the policy on a regular basis and have a guaranteed interest rate.
- **Living benefits —** the policyowner can borrow against the cash value while the policy is in effect, or can receive the cash value when the policy is surrendered. The cash value, also called nonforfeiture value, does not usually accumulate until the third policy year and it grows tax deferred.

Know This

Whole life insurance provides lifetime (permanent) protection and accumulates cash value.

The three basic forms of whole life insurance are straight whole life, limited-pay whole life and single premium whole life; however, other forms and combination plans may also be available.

### 1. Continuous Premium (Straight Life)

**Straight life** (also referred to as _ordinary life_ or _continuous premium whole life_) is the basic whole life policy (illustrated above). The policyowner pays the premium from the time the policy is issued until the insured’s death or age 100 (whichever occurs first). Of the common whole life policies, straight life will have the lowest annual premium.

### 2. Limited Payment

Unlike straight life, limited-pay whole life is designed so that the premiums for coverage will be completely paid-up well before age 100. Some of the more common versions of limited-pay life are 20-pay life whereby coverage is completely paid for in 20 years, and life paid-up at 65 (LP-65) whereby the coverage is completely paid up for by the insured's age 65. All other factors being equal, this type of policy has a shorter premium-paying period than straight life insurance, so the annual premium will be higher. Cash value builds up faster for the limited-pay policies.

Limited-pay policies are well suited for those insureds who do not want to be paying premiums beyond a certain point in time. _For example_, an individual may need some protection after retirement, but does not want to be paying premiums at that time. A limited-pay (paid-up at 65) policy purchased during the person's working years will accomplish that objective.

### 3. Single Premium

**Single premium whole life** (SPWL) is designed to provide a level death benefit to the insured's age 100 for a one-time, lump-sum payment. The policy is completely paid-up after one premium and generates immediate cash value.

### 4. Fixed (Equity) Indexed Life

The main feature of **indexed whole life** (or equity index whole life) insurance is that the cash value is dependent upon the performance of the equity index, such as S&P 500 although there is a guaranteed minimum interest rate. The policy's face amount increases annually to keep pace with inflation (as the Consumer Price Index increases) without requiring evidence of insurability. Indexed whole life policies are classified depending on whether the policyowner or the insurer assumes the inflation risk. If the policyowner assumes the risk, the policy premiums increase with the increases in the face amount. If the insurer assumes the risk, the premium remains level.
