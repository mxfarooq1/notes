There are many types of life insurance products available for consumers. Although all life insurance products offer death protection, each type also includes its own unique features and benefits and is designed to serve different insureds’ needs.

Regarding the length of coverage, all life insurance policies fall into 2 categories: temporary and permanent protection.

**Term insurance** is _temporary_ protection because it only provides coverage for a specific period of time. It is also known as pure life insurance. Term policies provide for the greatest amount of coverage for the lowest premium as compared to any other form of protection. There is usually a maximum age above which coverage will not be offered or at which coverage cannot be renewed.

Term insurance provides what is known as **pure death protection**:

- If the insured dies during this term, the policy pays the death benefit to the beneficiary;
- If the policy is canceled or expires prior to the insured's death, nothing is payable at the end of the term; and
- There is no cash value or other living benefits.

Know This

Term insurance provides the greatest amount of coverage for the lowest premium.   Term insurance has no cash value.

There are three basic types of term coverage available, based on **how the face amount (death benefit) changes** during the policy term:

- Level;
- Increasing; and
- Decreasing.

Regardless of the type of term insurance purchased, the premium is level throughout the term of the policy; only the amount of the death benefit may fluctuate, depending on the type of term insurance. Upon selling, renewing, or converting the term policy, the premium is figured at attained age (the insured's age at the time of transaction).

### 1. Level Term

**Level term insurance** is the most common type of temporary protection purchased. The word _level_ refers to the death benefit that does not change throughout the life of the policy.

Know This

"Level" in level term insurance refers to the death benefit, which does NOT change.

#### Level Premium Term

**Level premium** term, as the name implies, provides a level death benefit and a level premium during the policy term. _For example,_ a $100,000 10-year level term policy will provide a $100,000 death benefit if the insured dies any time during the 10-year period. The premium will remain level during the entire 10-year period. If the policy is renewed at the end of the 10-year period, the premium will be based on the insured’s attained age at the time of renewal.

#### Annually Renewable Term

**Annually renewable term** (ART) is the purest form of term insurance. The death benefit remains level (in that sense, it’s a level term policy), and the policy may be guaranteed to be renewable each year without proof of insurability, but the premium increases annually according to the attained age, as the probability of death increases.

In New York, the maximum age above which coverage will not be offered is 80.

### 2. Special Features: Renewable and Convertible

Most term insurance policies are renewable, convertible, or renewable and convertible (R&C).

The **renewable** provision allows the policyowner the right to renew the coverage at the expiration date _without evidence of insurability_. The premium for the new term policy will be based on the insured's current age. _For example_, a 10-year term policy that is renewable can be renewed at the end of the 10-year period for a subsequent 10-year period without evidence of insurability. However, the insured will have to pay the premium that is based on their attained age. If an individual purchases a 10-year term policy at age 35, they will pay a premium based on the age of 45 upon renewing the policy.

The **convertible** provision provides the policyowner with the right to convert the policy to a permanent insurance policy _without evidence of insurability_. The premium will be based on the insured's attained age at the time of conversion.
