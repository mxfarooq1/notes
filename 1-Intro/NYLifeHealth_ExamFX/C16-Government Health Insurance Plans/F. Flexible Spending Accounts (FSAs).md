### 1. Definition

A **Flexible Spending Account** (FSA) is a form of cafeteria plan benefit funded by salary reduction and employer contributions. The employees are allowed to deposit a certain amount of their paycheck into an account before paying income taxes. Then, during the year, the employee can be directly reimbursed from this account for eligible health care and dependent care expenses. FSA benefits are subject to annual maximum and "use-or-lose" rule. This plan does not provide a cumulative benefit beyond the plan year.

There are 2 types of Flexible Spending Accounts: a Health Care Account for out-of-pocket health care expenses, and a Dependent Care Account (subject to annual contribution limits) to help pay for dependent's care expenses which makes it possible for an employee and their spouse to continue to work.

An FSA is exempt from federal income taxes, Social Security (FICA) taxes and, in most cases, state income taxes, saving 1/3 or more in taxes. If the plan favors highly compensated employees, the benefits for the highly compensated employees are not exempt from federal income taxes.

FSAs may be used to pay medical and dental expenses for employees and their dependents.

### 2. Eligibility

Child and dependent care expenses must be for the care of one or more qualifying persons:

- A dependent who was under age 13 when the care was provided and who can be claimed as an exemption on the employee's Federal Income Tax return;
- A spouse who was physically or mentally not able to care for himself or herself; or
- A dependent who was physically or mentally not able to care for himself or herself and who can be claimed as an exemption (as long as the person is earning gross income less than an IRS-specified amount).

Persons who cannot dress, clean, or feed themselves because of physical or mental disability are considered "not able to care for themselves." Persons who require constant supervision to prevent them from injuring themselves or others are also considered "not able to care for themselves."

The insured may change benefits during open enrollment. After that period, generally, no other changes can be made during the plan year. However, the insured might be able to make a change under one of the following circumstances, referred to as _qualified life event_ changes:

1. Marital status;
2. Number of dependents;
3. One of dependents becomes eligible for or no longer satisfies the coverage requirements under the Medical Reimbursement plan for unmarried dependents due to attained age, student status, or any similar circumstances;
4. The insured, the insured's spouse's or qualified dependent's employment status that affects eligibility under the plan (at least a 31-day break in employment status to qualify as a change in status);
5. Change in dependent care provider; or
6. Family medical leave.

### 3. Contribution Limits

The IRS limits the annual contribution for Dependent Care Accounts to a specified amount that gets adjusted annually for cost of living. This is a family limit, meaning that even if both parents have access to flexible care accounts, their combined contributions cannot exceed the amount.
