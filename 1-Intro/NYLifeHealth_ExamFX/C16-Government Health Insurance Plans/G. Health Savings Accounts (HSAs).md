### 1. Definition

**Health savings accounts (HSAs)** are designed to help individuals save for qualified health expenses that they, their spouse, or their dependents incur. An individual who is covered by a high deductible health plan can make a tax-deductible contribution to an HSA, and use it to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses. Contributions by an employer are not included in the individual's taxable income.

### 2. Eligibility

To be eligible for a Health Savings Account, an individual must meet the following requirements:

- Be covered by a high-deductible health plan (HDHP);
- Not be covered by other health insurance (does not apply to specific injury insurance and accident, disability, dental care, vision care, long-term care);
- Not be eligible for Medicare (be under the age of 65); and 
- Not be eligible to be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return.

### 3. Contribution Limits

HSAs are linked to high-deductible insurance. A person may obtain coverage under a qualified health insurance plan with established minimum deductibles ($1,650 for singles and $3,300 for families in 2025).

Each year eligible individuals (or their employers) are allowed to save up to certain limits, regardless of their plan's deductible (current contribution limits are $4,300 for singles and $8,550 for families). When opening an account, an individual must be under the age of Medicare eligibility. For taxpayers aged 55 and older, an additional contribution amount is allowed (up to $1,000).

An HSA holder who uses the money for a **nonhealth** expenditure **pays tax** on it, plus a **20% penalty**. After age 65, a withdrawal used for a nonhealth purpose will be taxed, but not penalized.

Know This

Nonhealth withdrawals before age 65 = 20% penalty; nonhealth withdrawals after age 65 = no penalty.
