Medicare is a federal medical expense insurance program for people **age 65** and older even if the individual continues to work. Medicare benefits are also available to anyone, **regardless of age,** who has been entitled to Social Security disability income benefits for 2 years or has permanent kidney failure (End Stage Renal Disease — ESRD).

Persons age 65 years or older who are recent green card holders (permanent residents) or new immigrants to the U.S. and never worked in the U.S. may not immediately qualify for Medicare. If they don't qualify for free Medicare, they can still purchase it, if the following eligibility requirements are met:

- Are 65 years of age or older;
- Have recently become a U.S. citizen by naturalization and haven't worked enough quarters to have social security coverage; and
- Are lawfully admitted aliens (green card holders) who have constantly lived in the United States **for 5 years** or longer and don't qualify for the Social Security benefits.

### 1. Nature, Financing, and Administration

Medicare is administered by The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which is a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Medicare is divided into 4 parts:

1. **Part A (Hospital Insurance)** is financed through a portion of the payroll tax (FICA);
2. **Part B (Medical Insurance)** is financed from monthly premiums paid by insureds and from the general revenues of the federal government;
3. **Part C (Medicare Advantage)** allows people to receive all of their health care services through available provider organizations; and
4. **Part D (Prescription Drugs)** is for prescription drug coverage.

Note, however, that the term **Original Medicare** refers to Part A - Hospital Insurance, and Part B - Medical Insurance only. It covers health care from any doctor, health care provider, hospital or facility that accepts Medicare patients. It usually does not cover prescription drugs. Original Medicare does not require the patient to choose a primary care doctor, nor does it require a referral to see a specialist, as long as the specialist is enrolled in Medicare.

Know This

Part A is hospital insurance; Part B is medical insurance.

### 2. Part A - Hospital Insurance

**Medicare Part A** helps pay for inpatient hospital care, inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility, home health care, and hospice care.

#### Individual Eligibility Requirements

An individual is eligible for Medicare Part A, Hospital Coverage, by qualifying for one of the following conditions:

- A citizen or a legal resident of the United States age 65 or over and qualified for Social Security or Railroad retirement benefits — _Aged_;
    
- Is 65 years old or over and entitled to monthly Social Security benefits based upon the spouse’s work record, and the spouse is at least 62;
    
- Is younger than 65, but has been entitled to Social Security disability benefits for 24 months — _Disabled;_
    
- Has End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) — permanent kidney failure that requires dialysis or a transplant; and/or
    
- Has ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease) — automatically qualifies for Part A the month disability benefits begin.
    

Individuals who are not receiving those types of benefits need to sign up for Part A, even if they are eligible for premium-free Part A.

In addition, monthly Part A premiums are required when a beneficiary is not "**fully insured**" under Social Security, meaning they have not earned **40 quarters** of coverage (the equivalent of 10 years of work), and therefore, are entitled to receive Social Security retirement, premium-free Medicare Part A, and survivor benefits. If the beneficiary has paid Medicare taxes for fewer than 30 quarters, the standard Part A premium is $518. If Medicare taxes have been paid for 30-39 quarters, the standard Part A premium is $285.

#### Enrollment

Those who want to sign up for Medicare Part A have the following three options:

- **Initial enrollment period:** when an individual first becomes eligible for Medicare (starting 3 months before turning age 65, ending 3 months after the 65th birthday);
- **General enrollment period:** between January 1 and March 31 each year;
- **Special enrollment period:** at any time during the year if the individual or their spouse is still employed and covered under a group health plan.

Those who are not eligible for premium-free Part A can purchase the coverage for a monthly premium. If individuals fail to sign up for Part A when they are first eligible, the monthly premium may go up 10% unless the person becomes eligible for a special enrollment period.

In addition, there is the **annual Medicare open enrollment period** from **October 15 to December 7** each year. During this time, people with Medicare can review features of Medicare plans offered in their area and make changes to their Medicare coverage. Existing Medicare members can re-evaluate their plan and needs, and then add, drop, or switch their Medicare health plan. The changes go into effect on January 1 of the following year.

#### Coverages and Cost-sharing Amounts

**Inpatient Hospital Care** — Hospital insurance helps pay for up to 90 days in a participating hospital in any benefit period, subject to a deductible.

- Days 1 - 60 are covered at 100% of approved charges after the deductible is met;
- Days 61 - 90 are paid with daily coinsurance;
- After day 90, there is daily coinsurance while using the 60 lifetime reserve days.

The lifetime reserve days have a copayment that is twice that of days 61 through 90, and they are nonrenewable. Covered services include semi-private room, meals, regular nursing services, operating and recovery room costs, hospital costs for anesthesia, intensive care and coronary care, drugs, lab tests, X-rays, medical supplies, appliances, rehabilitation services, and preparatory services related to kidney transplant surgery. Blood is also covered, except for the first 3 pints.  

Under the inpatient hospital stay, Part A **does NOT include** private duty nursing, a television or telephone in the patient's room. It also does not include a private room unless medically necessary. In addition, Part A only pays for **up to 190 days** of inpatient psychiatric hospital care provided in a free-standing psychiatric hospital during the patient's lifetime.

Sixty (60) days of non-use of the inpatient hospital benefit starts a new benefit period and a new deductible.

**Skilled Nursing Facility Care** — Part A helps pay for up to 100 days in a participating skilled nursing facility in each benefit period, following a 3-day inpatient hospital stay for a related illness. To get this type of care, the insured's doctor must certify that daily skilled care is necessary. Covered expenses include semi-private room, meals, regular nursing and rehabilitation services, and other supplies.

**Home Health Care** — For an individual confined to the home and meeting certain other conditions, hospital insurance can pay the full approved cost of home health visits from a participating home health agency. There is no limit to the number of covered visits. Covered services include part-time skilled nursing care, physical therapy, and speech therapy. Hospital insurance also covers part-time services of home health aides, occupational therapy, medical social services and medical supplies and equipment.

**Hospice Care** — Under certain conditions, hospital insurance can help pay for hospice care for terminally ill insureds, if the care is provided by a Medicare-certified hospice. Covered services include doctor services, nursing services, medical appliances, supplies including outpatient drugs for pain relief, home health aide, homemaker services, therapies, medical social services, short-term inpatient care including respite care, and counseling.

Know This

Medicare Part A does not cover outpatient hospital care. That's covered under Medicare Part B.

### 3. Part B - Medical Insurance

**Medicare Part B** pays for doctor’s services and a variety of other medical services and supplies that are not covered by hospital insurance. Most of the services needed by people with permanent kidney failure are covered only by medical insurance.

#### Individual Eligibility Requirements

Part B is optional and offered to everyone who enrolls in Part A. Part B is funded by monthly premiums and from the general revenues of the federal government. Most people enrolled in Medicare Part B pay the **standard monthly premium**. However, if an insured's modified adjusted gross income reported on IRS tax return is above a certain amount, the insured may be required to pay a higher premium.

#### Enrollment

When you become eligible for Part A, you are told that you will get and have to pay for Part B unless you decline it. If you later decide you want Part B after initially declining it, you must wait until the next general enrollment period (Jan. 1 through Mar. 31) to enroll.

#### Coverages and Cost-sharing Amounts

After the annual medical insurance deductible is met, medical insurance will generally pay for 80% of the approved charges for covered expenses for the remainder of the year. There is no maximum out of pocket limit on the 20% coinsurance payable for Part B expenses.

**Doctor Services** — Part B covers doctor services no matter where received in the United States. Covered doctor services include surgical services, diagnostic tests and X-rays that are part of the treatment, medical supplies furnished in a doctor’s office, and services of the office nurse.

**Outpatient** **Hospital** **Services** — Part B covers outpatient hospital services received for diagnosis and treatment, such as care in an emergency room, outpatient clinic, or a hospital.

**Home Health Visits** — Medicare will pay for home health services as long as these services are recommended by the insured's doctor and the insured is eligible. However, these services are provided on a part-time basis with limits on the number of hours per day and days per week. The services that are not fully covered by Medicare will get coverage from Medicaid.

**Other Medical and Health Services** — Under certain conditions or limitations, medical insurance covers other medical services and supplies. Some examples are as follows: ambulance transportation; home dialysis equipment, supplies, periodic support services, independent laboratory tests, oral surgery, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology services, and X-rays and radiation treatments.

**Prescription Drugs (limited coverage)** — Only medicines that are administered in a hospital outpatient department under certain circumstances, such as injected drugs at a doctor’s office, some oral cancer drugs, or drugs that require durable medical equipment (like a nebulizer or infusion pump), are covered. Other than the examples above, insured under Part B will have to pay 100% for most prescription drugs, unless covered by Part D.

**Outpatient Treatment of Mental Illness** — Medicare covers outpatient treatment of an approved condition (such as depression or anxiety) in a doctor's office or other health care provider's office or hospital outpatient department. Generally, the enrollee pays 20% of the Medicare-approved amount (coinsurance); Part B deductible also applies. Note that inpatient mental health care is covered under Part A.

**Yearly "wellness" visit** — In addition to a "Welcome to Medicare" preventive visit available during the first 12 months, Medicare Part B covers annual "wellness" visit during which the insured and the provider can develop or update a personalized plan for disease prevention. There is no out-of-pocket cost for the insured for these visits if the doctor or other qualified health care provider accepts assignments. If the doctor or the health care provider performs additional tests or services during the same visit that are not covered under this preventive benefit, the insured may have to pay coinsurance, and Part B deductible may also apply.

#### Exclusions

Medical insurance under Part B of Medicare **does not cover** the following:

- Private duty nursing;
    
- Skilled nursing home care costs over 100 days per benefit period;
    
- Intermediate nursing home care;
    
- Physician charges above Medicare’s approved amount;
    
- Most outpatient prescription drugs;
    
- Care received outside the United States;
    
- Custodial care received in the home;
    
- Dental care (except dental expenses resulting from an accident only), cosmetic surgery, eyeglasses, hearing aids, orthopedic shoes, acupuncture expenses; or
    
- Expenses incurred due to a war or act of war.

- **Actual Charge** — The amount a physician or supplier actually bills for a particular service or supply.
    
- **Ambulatory Surgical Services** — Care that is provided at an ambulatory center. These are surgical services performed at a center that do not require a hospital stay unlike inpatient hospital surgery.

- **Excess Charge** — The difference between the Medicare-approved amount for a service or supply and the actual charge.
    
- **Intermediaries** — Organizations that process inpatient and outpatient claims on individuals by hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, hospices and certain other providers of health services.
    
- **Limiting Charge** — The maximum amount a physician may charge a Medicare beneficiary for a covered service if the physician does not accept assignments.
    
- **Nonparticipating** — Doctors or suppliers who may choose whether or not to accept assignments on each individual claim.
    
- **Outpatient Physical and Occupational Therapy and Speech Pathology Services** — Medically necessary outpatient physical and occupational therapy or speech pathology services prescribed by a doctor or therapist.

- **Partial Hospitalization for Mental Health Treatment** — A program of outpatient mental health care.
- **Participating Doctor or Suppliers** — Doctors and suppliers who sign agreements to become Medicare-participating. _For example_, they have agreed in advance to accept assignments on all Medicare claims.
    
- **Peer Review Organizations** — Groups of practicing doctors and other health care professionals who are paid by the government to review the care given to Medicare patients.

### 4. Part C - Medicare Advantage

The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 changed the name of **Part C** from Medicare+Choice to **Medicare Advantage**. Medicare Advantage plans must cover all of the services covered under the Original Medicare except hospice care and some care in qualifying clinical research studies. However, Part C plans may have lower out-of-pocket costs than Original Medicare. They may also offer extra coverage, such as vision, hearing, dental, and other health and wellness programs.

To be **eligible** for Medicare Advantage, beneficiaries must also be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. Medicare Advantage is Medicare provided by an approved Health Maintenance Organization or Preferred Provider Organization. Many HMOs or PPOs do not charge premiums beyond what is paid by Medicare. The advantages of an HMO or PPO for a Medicare recipient may be that there are no claims forms required, almost any medical problem is covered for a set fee so health care costs can be budgeted, and the HMO or PPO may pay for services not usually covered by Medicare or Medicare supplement policies, such as prescriptions, eye exams, hearing aids, or dental care.

Most Medicare HMOs require that medical services be received through the plan, except in emergencies. A few allow greater freedom of choice through point-of-service plans.

A Medicare **Private Fee-for-Service Plan** is a Medicare Advantage Plan offered by a private insurance company. Medicare pays a set amount of money every month to the private insurance company to provide health care coverage. The insurance company decides how much enrollees pay for the services they get.

Another section of Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C), **Special Needs Plans (SNP)**, provides more focused and specialized health care for specific groups of people. This includes people who have both Medicare and Medicaid, who reside in a nursing home, or have certain chronic medical conditions.

If the SNP is also an HMO, the insureds generally must get care and services from doctors, other health care providers, or hospitals in the plan's network (except for emergency care, out-of-area urgent care, or out-of-area dialysis). The members **may be required to have a primary care doctor.**

However, if the SNP is also a PPO, then the insureds may get services from any qualified provider or hospital, but usually at a higher cost than they would pay for services from a network provider.

Know This

Medicare Part C expands Original Medicare benefits through private health insurance programs.

### 5. Part D - Prescription Drug Insurance

The **Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003** (MMA) was passed in November 2003. This act implemented a plan to add a **Part D -** Prescription Drug Benefit to the standard Medicare Coverages. This **optional coverage** is provided through private prescription drug plans (PDPs) that contract with Medicare. To receive the benefits provided, beneficiaries must sign up with a plan offering this coverage in their area and must be enrolled in Medicare Part A or in Parts A and B. In areas where no private plans are offered, the government will offer a standard plan. Medicaid recipients are automatically enrolled.

Medicare beneficiaries will pay an extra 1% penalty for each month (12% per year) they could have signed up for Part D, but didn't.  

Medicare beneficiaries may choose between **stand-alone plans** that offer coverage on a fee-for-service basis, or **integrated plans** that group coverages together, including PPOs and HMOs (known as Medicare Advantage).

The plans offered by private companies are restricted by some standards set by Medicare, but may still be personalized. Providers must cover drugs for certain classes, but do not have to cover every drug in each class.

Those who sign up for the standard Prescription Drug Benefit plan will have a monthly premium and a deductible. Through 2024, most Medicare drug plans had a coverage gap (also called the "donut hole"). This means there's a temporary limit on what the drug plan will cover for drugs.

Starting in 2025, all Medicare plans will include a **$2,000 cap** on what the beneficiaries pay out-of-pocket for prescription drugs covered by the plan. Once a beneficiary reaches the out-of-pocket cap, they will automatically get **catastrophic coverage**, and are no longer required to pay copayment or coinsurance for medications for the remainder of the calendar year. In addition to the out-of-pocket cap, beneficiaries have the ability to spread drug costs across monthly payments throughout the year, as opposed to all at once. For those with low income, additional assistance is also available.

### 6. Primary, Secondary Payor

While an individual becomes eligible for Medicare upon turning age 65, federal laws extend primary coverage benefits under the employer’s plan to active older employees regardless of age. In other words, employer plans usually continue to be **primary** coverage, and Medicare is **secondary** coverage.
