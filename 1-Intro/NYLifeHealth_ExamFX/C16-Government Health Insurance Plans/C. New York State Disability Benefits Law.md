### 1. Purpose

Employers with one or more employees are subject to the New York State Disability Benefit Law. The law provides for payment of cash benefits to employees who become disabled because of sickness or injuries which have no connection to their employment. In workers compensation cases, the cost of medical expenses is borne by insurance carriers. The New York Disability Benefit Law provides income benefits for **nonoccupational injuries or diseases,** which prevent employees from earning a living, but does not provide medical or other benefits.

The New York Disability Benefits Law is administered by the Chairman of the Workers Compensation Board.  

### 2. Definitions

**Employer** — A person, partnership, association, corporation, or legal representative of a deceased employer, who has persons in employment as previously defined.

**Employee** — A person engaged in the services of an employer in any employment in any trade, business, or occupation carried on by an employer, except: a minor child of the employer; a domestic or personal worker in a private home who is employed for less than 40 hours per week by any one employer; a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister, priest or rabbi, a sexton, a Christian Science reader, or member of a religious order; or an executive officer of a corporation who owns all the outstanding stocks, and holds all the offices of the corporation.

**Disability (during employment)** — The inability of an employee, as a result of injury or sickness not arising out of and in the course of an employment, to perform the regular duties of their employment or the duties of any other employment that the employer may offer at the employee’s regular wages, and which the injury or sickness does not prevent the employee from performing. Disability also includes disability caused by or in connection with a pregnancy.

**Disability (during unemployment)** means the inability of an employee, as a result of injury or sickness not arising out of and in the course of an employment, to perform the duties of any employment for which the employee is reasonably qualified by training and experience.

### 3. Employment Covered

Employees eligible for coverage include those employed in any trade, business or occupation carried on by an employer. The following types of employment, however, would **not be considered eligible**:

- Services subject to the federal Railroad and Unemployment Insurance Act;

### 4. Benefits

New York State Disability Benefits are only paid when the individual cannot collect unemployment because of disability.

**Employed Individuals** — For an employed individual, disability benefits will be payable after a 7-day waiting period. The weekly benefit that the disabled employee is entitled to receive is one-half of the employee’s weekly wage; however, the benefit cannot exceed $170. If the employee’s weekly average wage is less than $20, the benefit is such average weekly wage.

**Unemployed Individuals** — An unemployed individual whose employment has been terminated and who, during a period of unemployment within 26 weeks immediately following such termination of employment, becomes ineligible for unemployment benefits, then becomes eligible for disability income coverage.

**Exclusions and Exemptions** — Employees are NOT entitled to benefits for:

- More than 26 weeks during 52 consecutive calendar weeks or during any one period of disability;
    
- Any period of disability during which an employee is not under the care of a licensed physician;
    
- Any disability caused by willful intention of the employee to bring about injury or sickness to themselves;
    
- Any day of disability during which the employee performed work for remuneration or profit;
    
- Any day of disability for which the employee is entitled to receive remuneration in an amount greater than that to which the employee would be entitled;
    
- Any period for which the employee is subject to disqualification or suspension of unemployment benefit rights;
    
- Any disability due to any act of war; or
    
- Any disability commencing before the employee becomes eligible for benefits.
