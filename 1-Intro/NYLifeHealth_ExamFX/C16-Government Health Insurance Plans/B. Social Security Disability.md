Social Security, also referred to as **Old Age Survivors Disability Insurance** — OASDI, is a federal program enacted in 1935, which is designed to provide protection for eligible workers and their dependents against financial loss due to old age, disability, or death. With a few exceptions, almost all individuals are covered by Social Security.  

### 1. Qualifications for Disability Benefits

Social Security uses the Quarter of Coverage (QC) system to determine whether an individual is qualified for Social Security benefits. The type and amount of benefits are determined by the amount of **credits** or **QCs** a worker has earned. Anyone working in jobs covered by Social Security or operating their own business may earn up to a maximum of 4 credits for each year of work.

The term **fully insured** refers to someone who has earned **40 quarters** of coverage (the equivalent of 10 years of work), and is therefore entitled to receive Social Security retirement, premium-free Medicare Part A, and survivor benefits. If an individual is entitled to premium-free Medicare Part A, they are automatically eligible for Medicare Part B, but must pay a monthly premium.

An individual can attain a **currently insured** status (or partially insured), and by that qualify for certain benefits if the individual has earned **6 credits** (or quarters of coverage) during the 13-quarter period _ending with the quarter in which the insured:_

- Dies;
- Becomes entitled to disability insurance benefits; or
- Becomes entitled to old-age insurance benefits.

For younger workers, the number of quarters required to qualify for the benefits differs by age according to a table established by Social Security.

### 2. Definition of Disability

Assuming that one qualifies for Social Security disability benefits by being _fully insured_ or _partially insured_, one must then meet Social Security’s definition of disability. **Disability**, under Social Security, is defined as the inability to engage in any substantially gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or result in an early death. **This definition is not as liberal as most definitions of disability found in policies marketed through insurance companies.**

### 3. Waiting Period

The waiting, or elimination period for Social Security disability benefits is **5 months**. Benefits begin at the beginning of the 6th month and are not retroactive to the beginning of the disability.

### 4. Disability Income Benefits

The amount of Social Security disability benefits is based upon the worker’s **Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)**, which is calculated based on the average indexed monthly earnings over the worker's highest 35 years. The lowest 5 years of income may be deleted from calculation.

Social Security disability benefits will continue for 3 months when a person returns to work making more than $1,160 per month (in 2025). This is an incentive to get people back to work.
