The Healthy New York program was created to make standardized, comprehensive, and affordable health insurance coverage available to individuals, sole proprietors, and small businesses. Beginning January 1, 2014, Healthy NY no longer provides coverage for individuals or sole proprietors. The program is now limited to qualified small employers only. Small employers can purchase coverage directly from their insurer or from New York State of Health Marketplace through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP).

To qualify for the Healthy NY program for **small employers**, a New York state-based business must meet the following requirements:

- Have 1-50 eligible employees;
- Have at least 30% of employees who work 20 or more hours per week earn no more than a specified wage level (the salary requirement is adjusted annually for inflation);
- Not have provided group health insurance coverage to its employees within the last 12 months, or have provided limited coverage only.

Coverage under Healthy NY program may be extended to the following:

- Employees, including the business owner;
- Employees' same-sex and opposite-sex spouses if residing in the household;
- Employees' domestic partners, if the employer decides to make domestic partner coverage available (the employer may also decide whether to make coverage available to same-sex domestic partners, opposite-sex domestic partners, or both);
- Employees' children to age 26.

Coverage under the Healthy NY program **may not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitations** in a qualifying group health insurance contract.
