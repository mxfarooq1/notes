In accordance with Section 1035 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain exchanges of life insurance policies and annuities may occur as nontaxable exchanges. When a policyowner exchanges a cash value life insurance policy for another cash value life insurance policy, or a cash value life policy for an annuity, or an annuity for an annuity, the policies or annuities **must be on the same life**. There will be no income tax on these transactions.

The following are allowable exchanges:

- A life insurance policy for another life insurance policy, an endowment contract, or an annuity contract;
    
- An endowment contract for another endowment contract or an annuity contract; or
    
- An annuity contract for another annuity contract.
    

Note that a policyowner may not exchange funds from an annuity into a cash value life policy. Nor would term life be used in a 1035 Exchange since it has no cash value. The key is that the exchange may not be from a less tax-advantaged contract to a more tax-advantaged contract. _"Same to same"_ is acceptable.

Know This

A 1035 exchange is a nontaxable exchange of cash value life insurance or an annuity on the same life.
