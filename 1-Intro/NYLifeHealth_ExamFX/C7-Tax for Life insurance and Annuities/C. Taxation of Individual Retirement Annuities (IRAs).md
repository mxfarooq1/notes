### 1. Traditional IRAs

#### Contributions, Deductible Amounts, and Distributions

The following taxation rules apply to **contributions** made to traditional IRA plans:

- Tax-deductible contributions for the year of the contribution (based on the person's income);
- Contributions must be made in **"cash"** in order to be tax deductible (the term _cash_ includes any form of money, such as cash, check, or money order);
- Excess contributions are taxed at 6% per year as long as the excess amounts remain in the IRA; and
- Tax-deferred earnings (the money that accumulates in the account) are not taxed until withdrawn.

A **distribution** from an IRA is subject to income taxation in the year the withdrawal is made. In case of an early distribution (prior to age 59 ½), a 10% penalty will also apply.

There are certain conditions, under which the 10% penalty for early withdrawals would not apply (penalty tax exceptions):

- Participant is age 59½;
- Participant is totally disabled;
- The money is used to make the down payment on a home (not to exceed $10,000, and usually for first-time homebuyers);
- Withdrawals are for post-secondary education expenses; and
- Withdrawals are for catastrophic medical expenses, or upon death.

#### Amounts Received by Beneficiary

If the owner dies before distributions have begun, the entire amount must be distributed in full on or before December 31 of the calendar year of the 5th anniversary of the owner's death, unless the owner named a beneficiary.

**Spouses** who are the sole designated beneficiary can do the following:

- Treat an IRA as their own;
- Base the required minimum distribution (RMD) on their own current age;
- Base the required minimum distribution on the decedent's age at death, reducing the distribution period by one each year; or
- Withdraw the entire account balance by the end of the 5th year following the account owner's death, if the account owner died before the required beginning date. If the account owner died before the required beginning date, the surviving spouse can wait until the owner would have turned 73 to begin receiving RMDs.

**Individual beneficiaries** other than a spouse must withdraw the entire amount from the account within **10 years** of the account owner's death. Non-spouse beneficiaries are not permitted to treat an inherited IRA as if it were their own: they are specifically not allowed to make contributions to the IRA or to roll over any amounts into or out of the inherited IRA.

Like the original owner, the beneficiary generally will not owe tax on the assets in the IRA until the distributions are received.  

### 2. Roth IRAs

The following taxation rules apply to Roth IRAs:

- Contributions are not tax deductible; and
- Excess contributions are subject to a 6% tax penalty.

Know This

Traditional IRA distributions are taxable; Roth IRA distributions are NOT taxable.
