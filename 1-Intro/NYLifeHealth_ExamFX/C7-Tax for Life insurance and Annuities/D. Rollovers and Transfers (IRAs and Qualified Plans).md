Situations exist in which a person may choose to move the monies from one qualified retirement plan to another qualified retirement plan. However, benefits that are withdrawn from any qualified retirement plan are taxable the year in which they are received if the money is not moved properly. There are 2 ways to accomplish this: a **rollover** and a **transfer** from one account to another.

A **rollover** is a tax-free distribution of cash from one retirement plan to another. Generally, IRA rollovers must be completed within 60 days from the time the money is taken out of the first plan. If the distribution from the first plan is paid _directly to the participant_, 20% of the distribution must be withheld by the payor. The 20% withholding of funds can be avoided if the distribution is made _directly_ _from the first plan to the trustee or administrator/custodian of the new IRA plan._ This is known as **direct rollover**.

The term **transfer (or direct transfer)** refers to a tax-free transfer of funds from one retirement program to a traditional IRA or a transfer of interest in a traditional IRA **from one trustee directly to another**.
