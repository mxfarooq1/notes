Generally speaking, the following taxation rules apply to life insurance policies:

- **Premiums** are not tax deductible; and
- **Death benefit:** 
    - Tax free if taken as a lump-sum distribution to a named beneficiary; and
    - Principal is tax free; interest is taxable if paid in installments (other than lump sum).

### 1. Amounts Available to Policyowner

As you have already learned, permanent life insurance provides living benefits. There are several ways in which policyowners may receive those living benefits from the policy.

#### Cash Value Increases

Any cash value accumulations in the policy can be borrowed against by the policyowner, or may be paid to the policyowner upon surrender of the policy. Cash values grow tax deferred. Upon surrender or endowment, any cash value in excess of cost basis (premium payments) is taxable as ordinary income. Upon death, the face amount is paid, and there is no more cash value. Death benefits generally are paid to the beneficiary income tax free.

#### Dividends

Since dividends are a return of unused premiums, they are not considered income for tax purposes. When dividends are left with the insurer to accumulate interest, the interest earned on the dividend account is subject to taxation as ordinary income each year interest is earned, whether or not the interest is paid out to the policyowner.

#### Policy Loans

The policyowner may borrow against the policy's cash value. Money borrowed against the cash value is not income taxable; however, the insurance company charges interest on outstanding policy loans. Policy loans, with interest, can be repaid in any of the following ways:

- By the owner while the policy is in force;
- At policy surrender or maturity, subtracted from the cash value; or
- At the insured's death, subtracted from the death benefit.

Know This

Policy loans from the cash value are NOT income taxable.

#### Surrenders

When a policyowner **surrenders** a policy for cash value, some of the cash value received may be taxable as income if the cash surrender value exceeds the amount of the premiums paid for the policy. When the owner withdraws cash value from a universal life policy (partial surrender), both the cash value and the death benefit are reduced by the surrender.

_Example:_

Consider the following scenario:

- Face amount: $300,000
    
- Premiums paid: $70,000
    
- Total cash value: $100,000
    

If the insured surrendered $30,000 of cash value, the full $30,000 would be income tax free. If the insured took out $100,000, the last $30,000 would be taxable because the $100,000 exceeds the premiums that were paid in by $30,000.

### 2. Amounts Received by Beneficiary

#### General Rule and Exceptions

Life insurance proceeds paid to a named beneficiary are generally **free of federal income taxation** if taken as a lump sum. An exception to this rule would apply if the benefit payment results from a _transfer for value_, meaning the life insurance policy is sold to another party prior to the insured's death.

Know This

Lump-sum cash payment of life policy proceeds are tax free for the beneficiary.

#### Settlement Options

With **settlement options**, when the beneficiary receives payments consisting of both principal and interest, the interest portion of the payments received is taxable as income. _For example,_ if $100,000 of life insurance proceeds were used in a settlement option paying $13,000 per year for 10 years, $10,000 per year would be income tax free and $3,000 per year would be income taxable.

Know This

In settlement options, the principal is tax free, but the interest is taxable.

| Premiums                           | Not tax deductible         |

| Policy loans                       | Not income taxable         |
| Policy dividends                   | Not taxable                |
| Dividend interest                  | Taxable in the year earned |
| Lump-sum death benefit             | Not income taxable         |
