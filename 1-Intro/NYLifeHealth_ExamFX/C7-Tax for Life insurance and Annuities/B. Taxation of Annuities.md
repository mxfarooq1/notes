### 1. Individually-owned

A portion of each annuity benefit payment is taxable, and a portion is not. The portion that is nontaxable is the anticipated return of the principal paid in. This is known as the _cost base_. The portion that is taxable is the interest earned on the principal. This is known as the _tax base._

The **exclusion ratio** is used to determine the annuity amounts to be excluded from taxes. The annuitant is able to recover the cost basis nontaxable. The cost basis is the principal amount, or the amount that was paid into the annuity, which is excluded from taxes. The rest of each annuity payment is interest that has been earned and is taxable.

#### Tax-deferred Accumulation

The cost base represents the premium dollars that have already been taxed and will not be taxed again when withdrawn from the contract. The interest accumulated in an annuity is the tax base, but the **taxes are deferred during the accumulation period.**

### 2. Corporate-owned

Corporate-owned annuities have different tax implications than individual annuities:

- Growth in the annuity is **not** tax deferred; and
- Interest income is **taxed** annually unless the corporation owns a group annuity for its employees, and each employee receives a certificate of participation.

|**Surrenders**|**Surrender value - past premium = amount taxable**|
|**Partial Surrenders**|**First In, First Out (FIFO)***|
|**Settlement Options -** death benefit spread evenly over income period (averaged). Interest payments in excess of death benefit portion are taxable.|   |
|**Estate Tax -** If the insured owns the policy, it will be included for estate tax purposes. If the policy is given away (possibly to a trust) and the insured dies within 3 years of the gift, the death benefit will be included in the estate.|   |

_*FIFO method applies to Life insurance only. The policyowner will receive their investment in the contract first before receiving any gains in the policy (or being taxed on those gains). Annuities follow a LIFO (last in, first out) format._
