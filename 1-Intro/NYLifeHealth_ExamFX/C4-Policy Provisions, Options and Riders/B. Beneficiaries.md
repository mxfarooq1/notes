### 1. Designation Options

The _beneficiary_ is the person or interest to which the policy proceeds will be paid upon the death of the insured. The beneficiary may be a person, class of persons (sometimes used with children of the insured), the insured's estate, or an institution or other entity such as a foundation, charity, corporation or trustee of a trust. Trusts are commonly used in conjunction with beneficiary designations to manage life insurance proceeds for a minor or for estate tax purposes (although naming a trust as beneficiary does not avoid estate taxes).

The beneficiary does not have to have an insurable interest in the insured. In addition, the policyowner does not have to name a beneficiary in order for the policy to be valid.

#### Individuals

The owner of a life insurance policy may name any individual as a beneficiary for the policy proceeds. The owner may name more than one individual, in which case the individual beneficiaries will split the benefit by the percentage specified in the policy.

Benefits designated to a **minor** will either be paid to the minor's guardian, or paid to the trustee of the minor if the trust is the named beneficiary, or paid as directed by a court. The guardian and trustee can be the same person. It is generally accepted not to be a good practice to have life insurance benefits payable to a minor.

#### Classes

A class of beneficiary is using a designation such as "my children." This term can be vague if the insured has been married more than once, has adopted children, or has children out of wedlock. An example of a class that is less vague is "children of the union of Jane Smith and James Smith." Many insurers encourage the insured to name each child specifically and to state the percentage of benefit they are to receive.

When naming beneficiaries, it is most prudent to be specific by naming each individual and by designating the exact amount to be given for that individual. Two class designations are available for use when an insured chooses to "group" the beneficiaries: **per capita** and **per stirpes**. Per capita, meaning _by the head_, evenly distributes benefits among the living named beneficiaries. Per stirpes, meaning _by the bloodline_, distributes the benefits of a beneficiary who died before the insured to that beneficiary's heirs.

_For example,_ Bryan purchased a $90,000 life insurance policy. He named his three sons, Quentin, Steve, and Patrick, as beneficiaries for equal shares. Quentin has two children of his own, Bob and Lou. Steve and Patrick are both married but have no children. Unfortunately, Quentin predeceases Bryan.

If Bryan selected the **per capita** designation, which means "by the head," with Quentin gone, only 2 named beneficiaries remain. Steve & Patrick each will receive $45,000 ($90,000 divided by 2). Quentin's children would not receive any benefits, since they were not named as beneficiaries.

If Bryan selected the **per stirpes** designation, which means "by the bloodline," Steve and Patrick would receive $30,000 each and Quentin's sons would share his allotment equally at $15,000 each.

#### Estates

If none of the beneficiaries is alive at the time of the insured’s death, or if no beneficiary has been named, the insured’s **estate** will automatically receive the proceeds of a life insurance policy. The death benefit of the policy may be included in the insured's taxable estate if this occurs.

Know This

If NO beneficiary is named, policy proceeds go to the insured’s estate.

#### Trusts

Trusts are commonly established for minors, or to create a scholarship fund. Trusts can be used for estate planning purposes, and when used properly, can keep life insurance death proceeds out of the insured’s taxable estate. They are, however, expensive to administer.

### 2. Succession

The beneficiary designation provides for levels of priority or choice. In the event that the primary beneficiary predeceases the insured, the contingent (secondary or tertiary) level in the succession of beneficiaries will be entitled to the death proceeds. Each level in the succession of beneficiaries is only eligible for the death benefit if the beneficiary(s) in the level(s) above them has died before the insured.

The **primary beneficiary** has first claim to the policy proceeds following the death of the insured. The policyowner may name more than one primary beneficiary, as well as how the proceeds are to be divided.

The **contingent** **beneficiary** (also referred to as _secondary_ or _tertiary_ beneficiary) has second claim in the event that the primary beneficiary dies before the insured. Contingent beneficiaries do not receive anything if the primary beneficiary is still living at the time of the insured’s death.

### 3. Revocable vs. Irrevocable

Beneficiary designations may be either revocable or irrevocable. The policyowner, without the consent or knowledge of the beneficiary, may change a **revocable** designation at any time. An **irrevocable** designation may not be changed _without the written consent of the beneficiary_. Irrevocable beneficiaries have a vested interest in the policy; therefore, the policyowner may not exercise certain rights _without the consent of the beneficiary_. In addition to being unable to change the beneficiary designation, the policyowner cannot borrow against the policy’s cash value (as this would decrease the policy face value until repaid) or assign the policy to another person _without the beneficiary's agreement_.

### 4. Common Disaster Clause

If the insured and the primary beneficiary die at approximately the same time from a common accident with no clear evidence as to who died first, a problem may arise in identifying which party is eligible for the death benefit. The **Uniform Simultaneous Death Law** has been adopted by most states to address this problem, and to protect the policyowner's original intent, as well as to protect the contingent beneficiary. This law stipulates that if the insured and the primary beneficiary died in the same accident and there is no sufficient evidence to show who died first, the policy proceeds are to be distributed as if the primary beneficiary died first.

The **Common Disaster Clause**, when added to a policy, provides that if the insured and the primary beneficiary died in a common disaster (even if the beneficiary outlived the insured by a specified number of days), it is presumed that the primary beneficiary died first, so the proceeds will be paid to either the contingent beneficiary or to the insured's estate, if no contingent beneficiary is designated. Most insurers specify a certain period of time, usually 14 to 30 days, in which the primary beneficiary's death must occur in order for the Common Disaster Clause to apply. As long as the beneficiary dies within this specified period of time following the death of the insured, it will still be interpreted that the beneficiary died first. The intent is to fulfill the wishes of the policyowner in regard to payment of proceeds to beneficiaries.

_Example:_

James had a life insurance policy that included a Common Disaster Clause. James was the insured; his wife Maggie was named the primary beneficiary, and his son Ben was named the contingent beneficiary. James and Maggie got in a terrible car accident, and James died immediately, but Maggie died 4 days later from her injuries from the same accident. Because the policy included the Common Disaster Clause, the death benefit would be paid to Ben, the contingent beneficiary, as if Maggie, the primary beneficiary, had died _before_ James, the insured.

Know This

Common disaster clause protects the contingent beneficiary.
