In this chapter you learned about provisions, options, and riders available in life insurance policies. Remember that provisions state the rights and obligations under the contract; riders modify provisions, and options specify ways to distribute policy proceeds. Let's recap the major points of this chapter:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**POLICY PROVISIONS**|   |
|**Required Provisions**|- Assignment<br>- Entire contract<br>- Grace period<br>- Incontestability<br>- Misstatement of age<br>- Ownership<br>- Payment of premiums<br>- Proof of death<br>- Reinstatement<br>- Right to examine (free look)<br>- Statements of the applicant/insured|
|**Exclusions**|- Aviation<br>- Hazardous occupation<br>- Suicide (within a specified time period)<br>- War or military service|
|**Beneficiaries**|- Designations: individuals, classes, estates, minors, trusts<br>- Succession - the levels of priority. Each level in the succession is only eligible if the beneficiary in the level above has died:<br>    - _Primary_ - first claim to the policy proceeds<br>    - _Contingent_ (secondary) - next claim after primary<br><br>- Policyowner's right to change a beneficiary:<br>    - _Revocable_ - can be changed at any time<br>    - _Irrevocable_ - can only be change with the beneficiary's consent<br><br>- _Common disaster clause_ - protects the rights of contingent beneficiaries; if the insured and the primary beneficiary died at approximately the same time, it is assumed that the primary beneficiary died first<br>- _Spendthrift clause_ - protects policy proceeds from the claims of creditors|
|**Policy Loans, Withdrawals and Partial Surrenders**|- Cash loans available - policy's cash value minus any unpaid loans and interest<br>- Automatic premium loans - prevent unintentional policy lapse due to nonpayment of premium<br>- Withdrawals and partial surrenders - available in Universal Life; a charge may apply|
|**OPTIONS**|   |
|**Nonforfeiture**|- Cash surrender value - after that, no more insurance<br>- Extended term - automatic option; uses cash value to convert to term insurance<br>- Reduced paid-up insurance - uses cash value as a single premium to purchase a permanent policy with a reduced face amount|
|**Dividend**|- Cash - insurer sends a check to the insured<br>- Reduction of premium - dividend is applied to the next year's premium<br>- Accumulation at interest - insurer keeps the dividend in an account where it accumulates interest<br>- One-year term - dividend is used to buy additional insurance<br>- Paid-up addition - dividend is used to increase the face amount|
|**Settlement**|- Cash - lump-sum payment; usually not taxable<br>- Interest only - insurer retains the principal and only pays out interest<br>- Fixed period - payments for a specified time period until all the proceeds are paid out<br>- Fixed amount - payments in specified amounts until all the proceeds are paid out<br>- Life income - provides an income the beneficiary cannot outlive; no guarantee that the principal will be paid out (if the beneficiary dies too soon); available as single life or as joint and survivor|
|**RIDERS**|   |
|**Disability**|- _Waiver of premium_ - waives the premium if the insured becomes totally disabled; 6 months waiting period before benefits begin<br>- _Waiver of cost of insurance_ - in Universal Life policies: waives the cost of insurance in the event of the insured's disability<br>- _Disability income_ - waives the premium and pays monthly income|
|**Accelerated Benefit**|- Early payment if insured is diagnosed with a specified catastrophic illness<br>- A portion of the death benefit<br>- Death benefit is reduced by the amount paid plus earnings lost by the insurer|
|**Additional Insureds**|- Spouse/other insured - term rider (limited time, limited coverage); usually expires when spouse turns age 65<br>- Children's term - covers all children of the insured (limited time, limited coverage); can be converted to a permanent policy<br>- Family term - spouse and children covered under one rider|
|**Riders that affect the Death Benefit**|- _Accidental death_ - pays double or triple indemnity if accidental death occurs as defined in the policy; death must occur within 90 days of accident<br>- _Guaranteed insurability_ - allows for purchase of additional insurance at specified times without evidence of insurability, at the insured's attained age<br>- _Cost of living_ - increases the face amount by a cost of living factor died to inflation<br>- _Return of premium_ - increasing term is added to a whole life policy that provides that if death occurs prior to a given age, not only is the death benefit payable to the beneficiary, but all premiums paid as well|
