While there is no "standard" policy form in life insurance, the standard policy provisions adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) create uniformity among life insurance policies.

### 1. Ownership

![](https://cdn-content-origin.examfx.com/Images/2085.png)

The parties to the insurance contract are the insurer, the policyowner, the insured, and the beneficiary. The policyowner and the insured may be the same person or different persons. Regardless, only the policyowner has the ownership rights under the policy, and not the insured or the beneficiary. Among the ownership rights are naming and changing the beneficiary, receiving the policy's living benefits, selecting a benefit payment option, and assigning the policy.

The _policyowner_ has the responsibility of paying the policy premiums, and is also the person who must have an insurable interest in the insured at the time of application for the insurance. When the owner and the insured are not the same person, the insurance arrangement is referred to as the third-party ownership.

### 2. Assignment

The policyowner of a life insurance policy has the right to transfer partial or complete ownership of the policy to another person without the consent of the insurer. However, the owner must notify the insurer in writing of the assignment. Without a written notice, the insurer may not recognize the assignment and would not assume responsibility for its validity. The company's major concern is paying the claim twice. Transfer of the life insurance policy **does not change the insured or amount of coverage**; it only changes who has the policy ownership rights.

The assignment provision specifies the policyowner's right to assign (transfer rights of ownership) the policy. The policyowner must advise the insurer in writing of the assignment. There are 2 types of policy assignment:

- **Absolute Assignment** – involves transferring **all rights** of ownership to another person or entity. This is a permanent and total transfer of all the policy rights. The new policyowner does not need to have an insurable interest in the insured.
- **Collateral Assignment** – involves a transfer of **partial rights** to another person. It is usually done in order to secure a loan or some other transaction. A collateral assignment is a partial and temporary assignment of some of the policy rights. Once the debt or loan is repaid, the assigned rights are returned to the policyowner.

Know This

Absolute assignment is the complete and permanent transfer of ownership rights; collateral assignment is the partial and temporary transfer of rights.

### 3. Entire Contract

The _entire contract_ provision stipulates that the **policy and a copy of the application**, **along with any riders or amendments**, constitute the entire contract. No statements made before the contract was written can be used to alter the contract. Neither the insurer nor the insured may change policy provisions once the policy is in effect without both parties agreeing to it and the change being affixed to the contract.

Know This

Entire contract = policy + copy of application + any riders or amendments

### 4. Right to Examine (Free Look)

This provision allows the policyowner a specified number of days from receipt to look over the policy and if dissatisfied for any reason, return it for a full refund of premium. The **free-look period starts when the policyowner receives the policy**, not when the insurer issues the policy. Certain types of policies may require a longer free-look period, or the period may be set by state statute.

In New York, the minimum free-look period is **10 days.** If the policy was sold by mail order, however, it must contain a 30-day free-look provision.

### 5. Payment of Premiums

The policy stipulates when the premiums are due, how often they are to be paid (monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually) and to whom. If the insured dies during a period of time for which the premium has been paid, the insurer must refund any unearned premium along with the policy proceeds. The payment of premium provision also stipulates that premiums must be paid in advance.

### 6. Grace Period

The grace period is the period of time after the premium due date that the policyowner has to pay the premium before the policy lapses (usually 30 or 31 days, or one month). The purpose of the grace period is to protect the policyholder against an unintentional lapse of the policy. If the insured dies during this period, the death benefit is payable; however, any unpaid premium will be deducted from the death benefit.

Know This

Grace periods protect policyholders from losing insurance coverage if they are late on a premium payment.

In New York, policies in which the amount and frequency of premiums may vary, must allow the policyholder a 61-day grace period. For all other policies, the grace period must be 31 days (or one month).

### 7. Reinstatement

The reinstatement provision allows a lapsed policy to be put back in force. The maximum time limit for reinstatement is usually **3 years** after the policy has lapsed. If the policyowner elects to reinstate the policy, the insured will have to provide evidence of insurability. The policyowner is required to pay all back premiums plus interest, and may be required to repay any outstanding loans and interest. The advantage of reinstating a lapsed policy as opposed to purchasing a new one is that the policy will be restored to its original status, and retain all the values that were established at the insured's issue age.

**Note that a policy that has been surrendered cannot be reinstated.**

### 8. Incontestability

The **incontestability** clause prevents an insurer from denying a claim due to statements in the application after the policy has been in force for **2 years**, even if there has been a material misstatement of facts or concealment of a material fact. During the first 2 years of the policy, an insurer may contest a claim if the insurer feels that inaccurate or misleading information was provided in the application. The incontestability period does not apply in the event of nonpayment of premiums; it also does not usually apply to statements relating to age, sex or identity.

### 9. Misstatement of Age

Because the age of an insured affects the premium that will be charged for a life insurance policy, if the applicant has misstated their age on the application, in the event of a claim, the insurer has the right to adjust the benefit to an amount that the premium would have purchased at the correct age of the insured.

Know This

Misstatement of age on the application will result in adjustment of premiums or benefits.

### 10. Statements of the Applicant

As you already know, all statements made by the applicant/insured are considered representations and not warranties, except in the case of fraud.

A **representation** is a written response to questions or statements made on an application for insurance which the applicant indicates are correct to the best of their knowledge, and upon which the underwriter relies to issue a policy. A **warranty** is a statement that is guaranteed to be true.

The distinction between a warranty and a representation is that if a warranty is untrue, the insurer has the right to void the contract. If a representation is untrue, the insurer has the right to cancel the contract only if the representation was material to the creation of the contract.

### 11. Proof of Death

Upon the death of the insured, an insurer will generally require proof of death before it will pay a claim. In many cases, this will consist of a copy of a death certificate and a form provided by the insurer to be completed by the claimant.

Upon receipt of a written proof of loss, the insurer must pay death claims immediately. (Most states interpret this to be within 30 days.) If there is no beneficiary named in the policy, the death proceeds are paid to the estate of the insured. (An insurer cannot delay the payment of a death claim until the settlement of the estate of the insured has been completed.)

### 12. Exclusions

**Exclusions** are the types of risks the policy will not cover. Certain exclusions are standard for all policies, while others are attached to the policy as an exclusion rider. The most common exclusions found in life insurance policies are aviation, hazardous occupation, and war and military service.

**Aviation —** Most life insurance will cover an insured as a fare-paying passenger or a pilot on a regularly scheduled airline, but will exclude coverage for noncommercial pilots, or require an additional premium for the coverage.

**Hazardous Occupations or Hobbies —** If the insured is engaged in a hazardous occupation or participates in hazardous hobbies (such as skydiving or auto racing), death that results from the hazardous occupation or hobby may be excluded from coverage. The underwriter also has the option of charging a higher premium for insuring these risks.

**War or Military Service —** Most life insurance policies issued today do not exclude military service. However, there are actually two different types of exclusions that may be used to limit the death benefit if the insured dies as a result of war, or while serving in the military. The **status clause** excludes all causes of death while the insured is on active duty in the military. The **results clause** only excludes the death benefit if the insured is killed as a result of an act of war (declared or undeclared).

The **suicide** provision in life insurance policies protects the insurers from individuals who purchase life insurance with the intention of committing suicide. Insurance policies usually stipulate a period of time during which the death benefit will not be paid if the insured dies by suicide. If the insured dies by suicide within **2** **years** following the policy effective date (issue date), the insurer's liability is limited to a refund of premium. If the insured dies by suicide after the 2-year period, the policy will pay the death proceeds to the designated beneficiary the same as if the insured had died of natural causes.
