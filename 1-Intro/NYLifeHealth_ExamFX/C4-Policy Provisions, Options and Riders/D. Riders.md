Riders are written modifications attached to a policy that provide benefits not found in the original policy. Riders sometimes require an additional premium, but they also help tailor a policy to the specific needs of the insured, and can be classified according to their primary purpose.

### 1. Disability Riders

Some riders provide benefits in the event of the insured’s disability, while other riders provide for partial payment of the death benefit prior to the insured’s death, called accelerated or living benefits riders.

#### Waiver of Premium

The **waiver of premium** rider waives the premium for the policy if the insured becomes totally disabled. Coverage remains in force until the insured is able to return to work. If the insured is never able to return to work, the premiums will continue to be waived by the insurance company. Most insurers impose a 6-month **waiting period** from the time of disability until the first premium is waived. If the insured is still disabled after this waiting period, the insurer will refund the premium paid by the insured from the start of the disability. This rider usually expires when the insured reaches age 65.

Know This

Waiver of premium rider waives the premium for a total disability after a waiting period.

#### Waiver of Cost of Insurance

The **waiver of cost of insurance** (or waiver of monthly deductions) rider is found in Universal Life Insurance. In the event of disability of the insured, this rider waives the cost of the insurance and other expenses, but does not waive the cost of premiums necessary to accumulate cash values.

#### Disability Income

With the **disability income** rider, in the event of disability the insurer will waive the policy premiums _and_ pay a monthly income to the insured. The amount paid is normally based on a percentage of the face amount of the policy to which it is attached.

#### Payor Benefit (Juvenile Insurance)

The **payor benefit** rider is primarily used with juvenile policies (any life insurance written on the life of a minor); otherwise, it functions like the waiver of premium rider. If the payor (usually a parent or guardian) becomes disabled for at least 6 months or dies, the insurer will waive the premiums until the minor reaches a certain age, such as 21. This rider is also used when the owner and the insured are two different individuals.

### 2. Accelerated (Living) Benefit

Accelerated death benefits allow the **early payment** of a portion of the death benefit if the insured has any of the following conditions:

- A terminal illness;
- A medical condition that requires an extraordinary medical intervention (such as an organ transplant) for the insured to survive;
- A medical condition that without extensive treatment drastically limits the insured's lifetime;
- Inability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs);
- Permanent institutionalization or confinement to a long-term care facility; or
- Any other conditions approved by the Department of Insurance.

The maximum benefit is typically a percentage of the face amount of insurance, usually 50%, but it is legal for the insurer to pay up to 100% of the death benefits before the insured dies. There may also be a dollar limit, such as $100,000. The face amount of insurance is reduced after the payments. The accelerated death benefit payout will not necessarily result in a reduction of the premium; however, premium may be waived.

Know This

Accelerated benefit = early payment of part of death benefit to the insured from the insurer for qualifying medical expenses.

**Long-Term Care (LTC)** coverage, which is often purchased as a separate policy, can also be marketed as a rider to a life insurance policy. These riders provide for the payment of part of the death benefit (called accelerated benefits) in order to take care of the insured’s health care expenses, which are incurred in a nursing or convalescent home. As with the living needs rider, payment of LTC benefits will reduce the amount payable to the beneficiary upon the insured’s death.

The application for a life insurance policy or policy rider which provides for accelerated payment of death benefits or a special surrender value must contain a notice, prominently displayed, to read as follows: "_Receipt of accelerated death benefits may affect eligibility for public assistance programs and may be taxable."_

It should also include the amount of any additional premium associated with the accelerated payment or, if there is no separately identifiable premium, whether a discount is associated with acceleration.

The application to accelerate benefits must be dated by the insurer upon transmittal and be completed and signed by the policyowner not more than **30 days** thereafter; and contain 2 notices, prominently displayed, to read as follows:

> "Receipt of accelerated death benefits may affect eligibility for public assistance programs such as medical assistance (Medicaid), family assistance and supplemental security income. Receipt of accelerated death benefits in periodic payments may be treated differently than receipt in a lump sum. Prior to applying for accelerated death benefits, policyowners should consult with the appropriate social services agency concerning how receipt will affect the eligibility of the recipient and/or the recipient's spouse or dependents."
> 
> "Receipt of accelerated death benefits may be taxable. Receipt of accelerated death benefits in periodic payments may be treated differently than receipt in a lump sum. Prior to applying for such benefits, policyowners should seek assistance from a qualified tax adviser."

The application to accelerate benefits must also contain a statement by the policyowner that the application is voluntary and without coercion on the part of any third party. The application will also contain a statement about the remaining death benefit available to the beneficiary.

Insurers are prohibited from paying accelerated death benefits or special surrender values to the policyowner or certificate holder for a period of **14 days** from the date on which the information listed below is transmitted in writing to the policyowner or certificate holder.

The policyowner or certificate holder has the right to rescind the request for such payments at any time during the process of application for benefits.

A group life insurance policy which provides for accelerated payment of death benefits or a special surrender value must provide that only the certificate holder has the right to accelerate the benefits.

#### Conditions for Payment

One trigger for activating the accelerated payment of the death benefit in policies issued in the state of New York is the diagnosis of a **medical condition which will require extraordinary care**. While the law technically allows an insurance company to advance the entire death benefit, most carriers impose their own cap, such as 50% of the death benefit.

#### Effect on Death Benefit

If an insured withdraws a portion of the face amount by the use of the accelerated benefits rider, the benefit payable at death will be reduced by that amount, plus the amount of earnings lost by the insurance company in interest income.

**Payable Death Benefit = Face Amount - Amount withdrawn - Earnings lost by insurer in interest**

_Example:_

The policy's face amount is $100,000; however, due to a terminal illness, the insured had to withdraw $30,000 from the policy 3 years before his death. Since this amount was withdrawn, the insurance company lost $300 worth of interest. Upon the insured's death, the beneficiary received $69,700 in death benefit:

$100,000 (face amount) - $30,000 (accelerated benefit) - $300 (lost interest) = $69,700

### 3. Riders Covering Additional Insureds

There are riders that allow the policyowner to add additional insureds under the original policy, such as children’s term or family term. There is also a nonfamily term rider that allows the policyowner to change the insured under the policy.

#### Spouse and Other Insured Term Rider

The **other insured rider** provides coverage for one or more family members other than the insured. The rider is usually level term insurance, attached to the base policy covering the insured. This is also known as a family rider. If the rider covers just the spouse of the insured, it can be specified as a **spouse term rider**, and allows the spouse to be added to coverage for a limited period of time and for a specified amount (it usually expires when the spouse reaches age 65).

#### Children's Term

The **children's term rider** allows children of the insured (natural, adopted or stepchildren) to be added to coverage for a limited period of time for a specified amount. This coverage is also term insurance and usually expires when the minor reaches a certain age (18 or 21). Most riders provide the minor with the option of converting to a permanent policy without evidence of insurability.

Children's term riders provide temporary life insurance coverage on all children of the family for **one premium**. The premium does not change on the inclusion of additional children; it is based on an average number of children.

Know This

Children’s term rider: one premium for ALL children.

#### Family Term

The **family term rider** incorporates the spouse term rider along with the children's term rider in a single rider. When added to a whole life policy, the family term rider provides level term life insurance benefits covering the spouse and all of the children in the family.

**Family Term = Spouse Term + Children's Term**

### 4. Riders Affecting the Death Benefit Amount

Some riders affect the amount of the death benefit paid out to the beneficiary, and either increase it through multiple indemnity or refunds of premiums, or decrease it if a portion of the death benefit was paid out to the insured while still living.

#### Accidental Death

The **accidental death rider** pays some multiple of the face amount if death is the result of an accident as defined in the policy. Death must usually occur within 90 days of such an accident. The benefit is normally two times (**double indemnity**) the face amount. Some policies pay triple the face amount (**triple indemnity**) for accidental death.

Each policy specifies what will be considered _accidental death_. Accidental death does not include death that results from any health problem or disability. In addition, death that results from self-inflicted injuries, war, or hazardous hobbies or avocations is usually not covered.

This rider often expires at the insured’s age 65. No additional cash value is accumulated as a result of this rider. The accidental death benefits apply only to the policy’s base face amount, and not to any additional benefits that may be purchased from policy dividends.

#### Guaranteed Insurability

The **guaranteed insurability rider** allows the insured to purchase additional coverage at specified future dates (usually every 3 years) or events (such as marriage or birth of a child), without evidence of insurability, for an additional premium. When this right is exercised, the insured purchases the additional coverage at the attained age. This rider usually expires at the insured's age 40.

The guaranteed insurability rider is not modified or defeated by the existence of other riders.

_Example:_

Alan's life insurance policy contains both guaranteed insurability and waiver of premium rider. Three years after the policy was issued, Alan was totally and permanently disabled. Not only are Alan's life insurance premiums waived, but at the specified times or events stated in the policy, Alan may purchase additional amount of insurance with the premiums on those increases also waived.

#### Cost of Living

The **cost of living** rider addresses the inflation factor by automatically increasing the amount of insurance _without evidence of insurability_ from the insured. The face value of the policy may be increased by a cost of living factor tied to an inflation index such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

#### Return of Premium

The **return of premium** rider is implemented by using increasing term insurance. When added to a whole life policy, it provides that at death prior to a given age, not only is the original face amount payable, but an amount equal to all premiums previously paid is also payable to the beneficiary. The return of premium rider usually expires at a specified age such as age 60.

#### Term Rider

Term riders allow for an additional amount of temporary insurance to be provided on the insured, without the need to issue another policy. They are usually attached to a whole life policy to provide greater protection at a reduced cost.
