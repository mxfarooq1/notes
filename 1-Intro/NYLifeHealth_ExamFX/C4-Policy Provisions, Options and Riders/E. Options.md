Policyowners have decisions to make about how the cash value in the policy should be protected, how the return of excess premium (dividends) should be invested, and how benefit payments will be made. The different choices available to them are categorized as Nonforfeiture Options, Dividend Options, and Settlement Options.

### 1. Nonforfeiture Options

Because permanent life insurance policies have cash values, certain guarantees are built into the policy that **cannot be forfeited** by the policyowner. These guarantees (known as nonforfeiture values) are required by state law to be included in the policy. A table showing the nonforfeiture values for a minimum period of 20 years must be included in the policy. The policyowner chooses one of the following nonforfeiture options: cash surrender value, reduced paid-up insurance, or extended term.

Know This

Nonforfeiture options are triggered by policy surrender or lapse.

#### Cash Surrender Value (Net Cash Value)

The policyowner simply surrenders the policy for the current cash value at a time when coverage is no longer needed or affordable. Upon receipt of the cash surrender value, if the cash value exceeds premiums paid, the excess is taxable as ordinary income. Once this option is selected, the insured is no longer covered. A policy that has been surrendered for its cash value cannot be reinstated. A _surrender charge_ is a fee charged to the insured when a life policy or annuity is surrendered for its cash value.

#### Extended Term

Under the extended-term option, the insurer uses the policy cash value to convert to term insurance for the **same face amount** as the former permanent policy. The duration of the new term coverage lasts for as long a period as the amount of cash value will purchase. If the policyowner has neglected to select one of these nonforfeiture options, the insurer will **automatically** implement the extended-term option in the event of termination of the original policy.

Know This

Extended term is the _automatic_ nonforfeiture option: same face amount, shorter term of coverage.

#### Reduced Paid-up Insurance

Under this option, the policy cash value is used by the insurer as a single premium to purchase a completely paid-up permanent policy that has a **reduced face amount** from that of the former policy. The new reduced policy builds its own cash value and will remain in force until death or maturity.

_Example: (review a sample Table of Guaranteed Values below):_

If the insured chooses to exercise the reduced paid-up option at the end of 15 years, the cash value of $8,100 can be used as a single premium to purchase paid-up insurance of the same type as the original policy. The insured doesn't have to pay any more premiums, while still retaining some amount of life insurance (in this example, $21,750).

The extended-term option indicates the option to use the policy's cash value to purchase in a single premium a term insurance policy in an amount equal to the original policy's face value (in this case, term insurance with $50,000 face amount). The insurance company determines that for this particular insured, $8,100 of cash value is worth 18 years and 8 days of $50,000 of protection.

### 2. Dividend Options

Dividends are paid only on participating policies. When purchasing a policy from a participating insurer, the policyowner actually pays a "grossed-up" premium. The higher premium is charged as a safety margin in the event the insurer's losses are higher than anticipated. If this extra amount is not needed by the insurer to pay death claims and expenses, or if actual mortality experience improves or interest earned by the company exceeds the assumptions, a dividend will be returned to the policyowner. In other words, dividends are a return of excess premiums, and for that reason they are **not taxable** to the policyowner. Insurance companies **cannot guarantee** dividends.

The first dividend could be paid as early as the first policy anniversary, but must occur **no later than the end of the third policy year**. From then on dividends are usually paid on an annual basis. Policyowners have the option of taking their dividends in one of several different ways.

Know This

Dividends are a return of excess premiums; therefore, not taxable when paid to the policyowner.

#### Cash Payment

The insurer simply sends the policyowner a check for the amount of the dividend as it is declared, usually annually.

#### Reduction of Premium

The insurer uses the dividend to reduce the next year's premium. _For example_, if the policyowner usually pays an annual premium of $1,000 and the insurer declares a $100 dividend, the policyowner would only pay a $900 premium that year.

#### Accumulation at Interest

The insurance company keeps the dividend in an account where it accumulates interest. The policyowner is allowed to withdraw the dividends at any time. The amount of interest is specified in the policy and compounds annually. Although the dividends themselves are not taxable, the **interest on the dividends is taxable** to the policyowner when credited to the policy, whether or not the policyowner receives the interest.

#### Paid-up Additions

The dividends are used to purchase a single premium policy in addition to the face amount of the permanent policy. No new separate policies are issued; however, each of these small single premium payments will **increase the death benefit** of the original policy by whatever amount the dividend will buy. In addition, each of these paid-up policies will accumulate cash value and pay dividends. The amount of additional coverage that can be purchased with the dividend is based on the insured's attained age at the time the dividend is declared.

If the policyowner did not chose the dividend option, the insurer will **automatically** use paid-up additions to increase the death benefit of the original policy by the amount the dividend will buy.

#### Paid-up Insurance

Usually, the insurer first accumulates the dividends at interest and then uses the accumulated dividends, plus interest, and the policy cash value to pay the policy up early. In other words, if the insured had a continuous premium whole life policy (in which premiums are paid to age 100), using the paid-up option the policyowner is able to pay up the policy early.

#### One-year Term

The insurance company uses the dividend to purchase additional insurance in the form of **one-year term insurance** that increases the overall policy death benefit. The policyowner's choice is to either use the dividend as a single premium on as much one-year term insurance as it will buy, or to purchase one-year term insurance equal to the policy's cash value for as long as it will last. If the insured dies during the one-year term, the beneficiary receives both the death benefit of the original policy and the death benefit of the one-year term insurance.

### 3. Settlement Options

Settlement options are the methods used to pay the death benefits to a beneficiary upon the insured's death, or to pay the endowment benefit if the insured lives to the endowment date. The policyowner may select a settlement option at the time of policy application, and may also change that option at any time during the life of the insured. Once selected by the policyowner, the settlement option cannot be changed by the beneficiary. If the policyowner does not select a settlement option, the beneficiary will be allowed to choose one at the time of the insured's death.

Know This

Settlement options are triggered by the insured’s death or age 100.

#### Cash Payment

Upon the death of the insured, or at the point of endowment, the contract is designed to pay the proceeds in cash, called a **lump sum**, unless the recipient chooses a different mode of settlement. If no selection is made, the proceeds are **automatically** paid to the beneficiary in a single cash payment. As a rule, payments of the principal face amount after the insured's death are not taxable as income.

#### Life Income

The **life-income option**, also known as **straight life**, provides recipients with an income that they cannot outlive. Installment payments are guaranteed for as long as the recipient lives, irrespective of the date of death. The amount of each installment paid is based on the **recipient's** **life expectancy** and the amount of principal. If the beneficiary lives for a very long time, payments may exceed the total principal. However, if the beneficiary dies shortly after starting to receive installments, the balance of the principal is forfeited to the insurer. Because there is a chance that the beneficiary may not live long enough to receive all the life insurance proceeds, insurers make options available which provide at least a partial guarantee that some or all of the proceeds will be paid out. With each of the guarantees, the size of the installment is decreased.

Know This

Under life-income (straight life) settlement option, the recipient cannot outlive the benefit payments.

##### Single Life

The **single life option** can provide a single beneficiary income for the rest of their life. Upon the death of the beneficiary, the payments stop.

##### Joint and Survivor

The **life income joint and survivor** option guarantees an income for two or more recipients for as long as they live. Most contracts provide that the surviving recipient will receive a reduced payment after the first recipient dies.

Most commonly, the reduced option is written as “joint and ½ survivor” or "joint and 2/3 survivor,” in which the surviving beneficiary receives ½ or 2/3 of what was received when both beneficiaries were alive. This option is commonly selected by the policyowner who wants to protect two beneficiaries, such as elderly parents. Unless a period certain option is also chosen, as with the life income option, there is no guarantee that all the life insurance proceeds will be paid out if all beneficiaries die shortly after the installments begin. This option guarantees, however, an income for the lives of all beneficiaries.

##### Life Refund

The **life refund income** option comes in either a _cash refund_ form or an _installment refund_ form. Both options guarantee that the total annuity fund will be paid out to the annuitant or to the beneficiary. The difference between the two options is that under the **cash refund option**, if the annuitant dies before the annuity fund is depleted, a lump-sum settlement of the remainder would be made to the beneficiary, while under the **installment refund option,** the beneficiary would receive the remaining funds in the form of continued annuity payments.

##### Life with Period Certain

Under **life income with period certain option**, the recipient is provided with the "best of both worlds" in terms of a lifetime income and a guaranteed installment period. Not only are the payments guaranteed for the lifetime of the recipient, but there is also a specified period that is guaranteed. _For example_, a life income with 10 years certain option would provide the recipient with an income for as long as they live. If the recipient dies shortly after starting to receive the payments, the payments will be continued to a beneficiary for the remainder of the 10-year period. As already stated, the installments for the life income with period certain option will be smaller than the life income only option.

#### Interest Only

With the **interest-only option**, the insurance company retains the policy proceeds and pays interest on the proceeds to the recipient (beneficiary) at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually). The insurer usually guarantees a certain rate of interest and will often pay interest in excess of the guaranteed rate. The interest option is considered to be a temporary option since the proceeds are retained by the insurer until some later point when the proceeds are paid out in a lump sum or paid under one of the other settlement options. When the beneficiary is allowed to select a settlement option, the interest option is sometimes used as a temporary option if the beneficiary needs some time to decide which settlement option to select. _For example,_ the policyowner may specify that interest only will be paid annually to the surviving spouse, with the principal to be paid to their children when they reach a certain age or at the death of the surviving spouse.

#### Fixed-period Installments

Under the **fixed-period installments option** (also called **period certain**), a specified period of years is selected, and equal installments are paid to the recipient. The payments will continue for the specified period even if the recipient dies before the end of that period. In the event of the recipient's death, the payments would continue to a beneficiary. The size of each installment is determined by the amount of principal, guaranteed interest, and the length of period selected. The longer the period selected, the smaller each installment will be. This option does not guarantee income for the life of the beneficiary; however, it does guarantee that the entire principal will be distributed.

#### Fixed-amount Installments

The **fixed-amount installments option** pays a fixed, specified amount in installments until the proceeds (principal and interest) are exhausted. The recipient selects a specified fixed dollar amount to be paid until the proceeds are gone. If the beneficiary dies before the proceeds are exhausted, installments will continue to be paid to a contingent beneficiary until all proceeds have been paid out. With this option, the size of each installment will determine how long benefits will be received. The larger the installment, the shorter the income period will be. As with the fixed-period option, this option does not guarantee payments for the life of the beneficiary, but does guarantee that all proceeds will be paid out.

##### Spendthrift Clause

The **spendthrift clause**, when included in a life insurance policy, protects beneficiaries from the claims of their creditors, as well as prevents the beneficiary's reckless spending of benefits by requiring that the benefits be paid in a fixed period or fixed-amount installments. The beneficiary does not have the right to select a different settlement option and is not allowed to assign or borrow any of the proceeds. The spendthrift clause is designed to protect life insurance policy proceeds that have not yet been paid to a named beneficiary from the claims of the creditors of the beneficiary or policyowner.
