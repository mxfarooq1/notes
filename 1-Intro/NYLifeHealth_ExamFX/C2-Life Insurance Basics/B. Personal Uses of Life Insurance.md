### 1. Survivor Protection

The death of the primary wage-earner will usually stop the flow of income to a family. The death of a nonearning spouse who cares for minor children can also cause great financial hardship for the survivors. Life insurance can provide the funds necessary for the survivors of the insured to be able to maintain their lifestyle in the event of the insured's death. This is known as **survivor protection.** Planning for survivor protection requires careful examination of current assets and liabilities as well as determining what survivors' needs may be.

### 2. Estate Creation

A person may create an estate through earnings, savings, and investments, but all of these methods require disciplined action and a significant period of time. The purchase of life insurance **creates an immediate estate**. Estate creation is especially important for young families that are getting started and have not yet had time to accumulate assets. When an insured purchases a life insurance policy, that creates an estate of at least that amount the moment the first premium is paid. There is no other legal method by which an immediate estate can be created at such a small cost.

### 3. Cash Accumulation

Life insurance may be used to accumulate specific amounts of monies for specific needs with guarantees that the money will be available when needed. _For example_, some life policies (those that provide permanent protection, such as whole life) accumulate cash value that is available to the policyowner during the policy term.

### 4. Liquidity

As a result of the cash accumulation feature, some life insurance policies provide **liquidity** to the policyowner. That means the policy’s cash values can be borrowed against at any time and used for immediate needs.

### 5. Estate Conservation

Life insurance proceeds may be used to pay inheritance taxes and federal estate taxes so that it is not necessary for the beneficiaries to sell off the assets.
