### 1. Solicitation and Sales Presentations

The process of issuing a life insurance policy begins with solicitation. In simplest terms, _solicitation of insurance_ means an attempt to persuade a person to buy an insurance policy, and it can be done orally or in writing. This includes providing information about available products, describing the policy benefits, making recommendations about a specific type of policy, and trying to secure a contract between the applicant and the insurance company.

Any sales presentations used by insurers or their agents in communication with the public must be accurate and complete.

Before starting a life insurance sales presentation, it must be disclosed to a prospective purchaser that a producer is acting as a life insurance agent or broker, and the producer must provide the full name of the insurer they represent. In transactions in which an agent or broker is not involved, the insurer must identify its full name.

#### Advertisements

First and foremost, **advertising must be accurate and not misrepresent the facts**. Advertising rules apply to any insurance advertisement intended for presentation, distribution, dissemination or other advertising use when used or made either directly or indirectly by or on behalf of the insurance company.

Every insurance company must establish and maintain a system of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of all advertising of its policies. The **insurer** whose policies are advertised is **responsible for all its advertisements**, regardless of who wrote, created, presented, or distributed them.

Insurance agents, brokers or other persons **cannot** use an advertisement or public announcement in this state if it does any of the following:

- Calls attention to any unauthorized insurer; or
- Publicizes the financial condition of any insurer.

Every agent of any insurer and every insurance broker must state the **full name of the insurer** referred to and the **name of the city** in which it has its principal office. This rule applies to all advertisements, public announcements, signs, pamphlets, circulars and cards that refer to an insurer.

#### Buyer's Guide

A **buyer’s guide** provides basic information about life insurance policies. It explains how a buyer should go about choosing the amount and type of insurance, and provides a cost comparison for similar policies. It must contain only the language approved by the Superintendent. The buyer’s guide must be provided prior to or at the **time of application**. When an insurer solicits a policy by mail, without the use of an agent, each initial solicitation must include a copy of the buyer's guide. If a policy offers a 30-day period for policy refund (free-look), the buyer's guide may be provided at the time the policy is delivered.

#### Policy Summary

A **policy summary** is a written statement describing the **features and elements** of the policy being issued. It must include the name and address of the agent, the full name and home office or administrative office address of the insurer, and the generic name of the basic policy and each rider. A policy summary will also include premium, cash value, dividend, surrender value and death benefit figures for specific policy years. The policy summary must be provided when the policy is delivered.

Know This

A buyer's guide provides _generic_ information on various types of policies. A policy summary provides _specific_ information on the policy being issued.

#### Illustrations

The term **_illustration_** means a presentation or depiction that includes nonguaranteed elements of a life insurance policy over a period of years.

##### General Rules

An illustration used in the sale of a life insurance policy must contain the following basic information:

- Name of insurer;
- Name and business address of producer or insurer's authorized representative, if any;
- Name, age, and sex of proposed insured, except when a composite illustration is permitted under this regulation;
- Underwriting or rating classification upon which the illustration is based;
- Generic name of policy, the company product name (if different), and form number;
- Initial death benefit;
- Dividend option election or application of nonguaranteed elements, if applicable
- Illustration date; and
- A prominent label stating “Life Insurance Illustration.”

##### Prohibited Practices

When using an illustration in the sale of a life insurance policy, an insurer or its producers **may NOT do** any of the following:

- Represent the policy as anything other than a life insurance policy;
- Describe nonguaranteed elements in a manner that could be misleading;
- Use an illustration that depicts policy's performance as being more favorable than it really is;
- Provide an incomplete illustration;
- Claim that premium payments will not be required for each year of the policy in order to maintain the illustrated death benefits, unless that is the fact;
- Use the term "vanish" or "vanishing premium," or a similar term that implies the policy becomes paid up; or
- Use an illustration that is not self-supporting.

If an interest rate used to determine the illustrated nonguaranteed elements is shown, it may not be greater than the earned interest rate underlying the disciplined current scale.

#### Use of Senior-Specific Certifications and Professional Designations

The purpose of this regulation is to establish standards to protect consumers from misleading and fraudulent marketing practices with respect to the use of senior-specific certification and professional designations in the solicitation and sale of life insurance policies and annuity contract.

Producers are not permitted to use senior-specific certifications or professional designations in such a way that may mislead an applicant, or imply that the producer has special training or certification in advising or providing services to seniors. Producers are prohibited from using titles or acronyms that imply designations that are not actually earned, nonexistent or self-conferred.

Special consideration must be given to the use of terms such as _senior, retirement, elder,_ and their combination with terms such as _certified, registered, chartered, advisor, specialist,_ or similar (e.g. _certified senior advisor_ or _certified elder planning specialist)_.

Designations and certifications are permitted if an organization or certification has been accredited by The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the National Commission for Certifying Agencies, or any organization that is on the US Department of Education's "Accrediting Agencies Recognized for Title IV Purposes" list.

#### Replacement

**Replacement** is a practice of terminating an existing policy or letting it lapse, and obtaining a new one. To make sure that replacement is appropriate and in the best interests of the policyowner, insurance producers and companies must take special underwriting measures to help policyowners make informed decisions.

**Replacement** means any transaction in which new life insurance or a new annuity is purchased and, as a result, the existing life insurance or annuity has been or will be any of the following:

- Lapsed, forfeited, surrendered, or otherwise terminated;
    
- Reissued with any reduction in cash value;
    
- Converted to reduced paid-up insurance, continued as extended term insurance or otherwise reduced in value by the use of nonforfeiture benefits or other policy values;
    
- Amended so as to affect either a reduction in benefits or in the term for which coverage would otherwise remain in force or for which benefits would be paid; or
    
- Used in a financed purchase.

**Replacing insurer** is the company that issues the new policy.  
**Existing insurer** is the company whose policy is being replaced.

**Duties of the replacing producer:**

- Present to the applicant a **Notice Regarding Replacement** that is signed by both the applicant and the producer. A copy must be left with the applicant;
- Obtain a list of all existing life insurance and/or annuity policies to be replaced including policy numbers and the names of all companies being replaced;
- Leave the applicant with the original or a copy of written or printed communications used for presentation to the applicant; and
- Submit to the replacing insurance company a copy of the replacement notice with the application.

Each producer who initiates the application must submit the following to the insurance company with or as part of each application:

- A statement signed by the applicant as to whether replacement of existing life insurance or annuity is involved in the transaction; and
    
- A signed statement as to whether the producer knows replacement is or may be involved in the transaction.
    

**Duties of the replacing insurance company:**

- Require from the producer a list of the applicant’s life insurance or annuity contracts to be replaced and a copy of the replacement notice provided to the applicant; and
    
- Send each existing insurance company a written communication advising of the proposed replacement within a specified period of time of the date that the application is received in the replacing insurance company’s home or regional office. A policy summary or ledger statement containing policy data on the proposed life insurance or annuity must be included.

#### Suitability in Life Insurance and Annuities

An insurance producer may not recommend the purchase, sale, or exchange of an insurance policy or annuity contract without the reasonable belief that the transaction is in the best interest of the insured.

It is a producer's responsibility to make sure that annuity transactions address consumers' needs and financial objectives. To ensure suitability, producers must make a reasonable effort to obtain relevant information from the consumer and evaluate the following factors:

- Age;
- Annual income;
- Tax status;
- Financial needs and timeline;
- Investment objectives;
- Liquidity needs and liquid net worth;
- Existing assets;
- Intended use of annuity;
- Financial experience; and
- Risk tolerance.

When producers or insurers recommend an annuity replacement, they must make sure the replacement is suitable for the consumer, and must consider whether the consumer will:

- Incur a surrender charge or be subject to a new surrender period;
- Lose existing contractual benefits;
- Have tax penalties for contract surrender;
- Have increased fees, investment advisory fees or charges for riders; or
- Have replaced another annuity in the preceding 36 months; or
- Benefit from annuity contract enhancements and improvement.

Insurers must make sure that producers are adequately trained to make recommendations and must supervise producers' compliance.

### 2. Underwriting

**Underwriting** is the risk selection and classification process. It involves a careful analysis of many different factors to determine the acceptability of applicants for insurance. In other words, underwriting is the process in which an insurance company determines whether or not a particular applicant is insurable, and if so, what premium to charge.

The primary criteria an underwriter will use in assessing the desirability of a particular candidate for life insurance are the applicant's health (current and past), occupation, lifestyle, and hobbies or habits. The underwriter will use many different sources of information in determining the insurability of the individual risk.

#### Field Underwriting

The agent is the company's front line, and is referred to as a **field underwriter** because the agent is usually the one who has solicited the potential insured. As a field underwriter, the agent has many important responsibilities during the underwriting process and beyond, including the following:

- Proper solicitation of applicants;
- Helping prevent adverse selection;
- Completing the application;
- Obtaining the required signatures;
- Collecting the initial premium and issuing the receipt, if applicable; and
- Delivering the policy.

Know This

A life insurance producer is the company's _field underwriter_.

##### Application

**The Application** is the starting point and basic source of information used by the company in the risk selection process. Although applications are not uniform and may vary from one insurer to another, they all have the same basic components: Part 1 - General Information and Part 2 - Medical Information.

**Part 1 - General Information** of the application includes the general questions about the applicant, such as name, age, address, birth date, gender, income, marital status, and occupation. It will also inquire about the existing policies and if the proposed insurance will replace them. Part 1 identifies the type of policy applied for and the amount of coverage, and usually contains information concerning the beneficiary.

**Part 2 - Medical Information** of the application includes information on the prospective insured's medical background, present health, any medical visits in recent years, medical status of living relatives, and causes of death of deceased relatives. If the amount of insurance is relatively small, the agent and the proposed insured will complete all of the medical information. That would be considered a _nonmedical_ application. For larger amounts, the insurer will usually require some sort of medical examination by a professional.

It is the agent’s responsibility to make certain that the application is filled out completely, correctly, and to the best of the applicant's knowledge. The agent must probe beyond the stated questions in the application if the agent has any reason to believe the applicant is misrepresenting or concealing information, or does not understand the specific questions asked. Any information that is misleading, inaccurate or illegible may delay the issuance of the policy. If the agent feels that there could be some misrepresentation, the agent must inform the insurance company. Some insurers require that the applicant complete the application under the agent’s watchful eye, while other insurers require that the agent complete the application in order to help avoid mistakes and unanswered questions.

###### Agent's Report

As a field underwriter, the agent (or producer) can be considered the most important source of information available to the company underwriters. The **agent's (producer's) report** provides the agent's personal observations concerning the proposed insured. The insurer may inquire whether the agent knows of any adverse information about the applicant, or ask the agent to express an opinion about the applicant's character, financial standing, and environment. The agent's report does not become a part of the entire contract, although it is a part of the application process.

##### Signatures Required

**Both the agent and the proposed insured (usually the applicant) must sign the application**. If the proposed insured and the policyowner are not the same person, such as a business purchasing insurance on an employee, then the policyowner must also sign the application. An exception to the proposed insured signing the application would be in the case of an adult, such as a parent or guardian, applying for insurance on a minor child.

##### Changes on the Application and Amendments

When an answer to a question on the application needs to be corrected, agents have the option, depending on which insurer they represent, of correcting the information and having the applicant initial the change, or completing a new application. An agent should never erase or white out any information on an application for insurance.

##### Premiums with the Application

Most agents attempt to collect the initial premium and submit it along with the application to the insurer. In addition, collecting the initial premium at the time of the application increases the chance that the applicant will accept the policy once it is issued. Whenever the agent collects premiums, the agent must issue a **premium receipt**. The type of receipt issued will determine when coverage will be effective.

The most common type of receipt is a **conditional receipt**, which is used only when the applicant submits a prepaid application. The conditional receipt says that coverage will be _effective either on the date of the application_ or the _date of the medical exam_, whichever occurs last, as long as the applicant is found to be insurable as a standard risk, and policy is issued exactly as applied for. This rule will not apply if a policy is declined, rated, or issued with riders excluding specific coverages.

_Example:_

If an agent collects the initial premium from an applicant and gives the applicant a conditional receipt, and the applicant dies the next day, the underwriting process will proceed as though the applicant were still alive. If the insurer ends up approving the coverage, then the applicant's beneficiary will receive the death benefit of the policy. If, on the other hand, the insurer determines that the applicant was not an acceptable risk and declines the coverage, the premium will be refunded to the beneficiary, and the insurer is not required to pay the death benefit.

Know This

Conditional receipt means the applicant may be covered as early as the date of the application.

The **unconditional (binding) receipt** is used most often with property and casualty insurance. With the binding receipt, coverage begins immediately for a specific length of time, until the policy is issued. Binding receipts usually stipulate that coverage is effective from the date of the application for only a specified period of time, such as 30 or 60 days, or until the company either issues or declines coverage, whichever occurs first.

##### Notice of Information Practices

Insurers and producers must provide a **notice of information practices** to applicants and policyholders in connection with insurance transactions. The notice is usually required at the time an insurer or producer first collects personal information from a source other than the applicant or public records, or at policy delivery if the information is collected from the applicant or from public records. In the case of a policy renewal, the notice must be provided at the policy renewal date or annually.

#### Company Underwriting

In order to properly select and classify insurance risks, the insurer needs to obtain the applicants' background information and medical history. There are several sources of underwriting information that are available to the underwriters.

##### Information Sources and Regulations

###### Application

The person applying for insurance must submit an application to the insurer for approval for a policy to be issued. The application is one of the main sources of underwriting information for the company.

Know This

An insurance application is the _key source_ underwriters use for information about the applicant.

###### Agent's Report

The agent's report allows the agent to communicate with the underwriter and provide information about the applicant known by the agent that may assist in the underwriting process.

###### Attending Physician Statement

When smaller amounts of insurance are requested and there is no prior medical history of concern, the home office underwriter may make an underwriting decision solely on the basis of the application. If, however, the underwriter sees answers to certain questions that could indicate greater risk, and the underwriter wants to obtain specific medical details, the underwriter will request a statement from the applicant's physician. This is called an **Attending Physician Statement (APS).** The insurance company must pay for this information, but it is often less expensive than ordering an examination.

The next step would be a paramedical exam (which often includes blood work and a urine sample). A paramedical exam is conducted by a registered nurse or a paramedic. Under certain circumstances the underwriter may require a full medical examination by a licensed physician for additional information. All these are at the insurer's expense.

A full medical exam occurs routinely for applicants requesting higher amounts of coverage, or if the application raised additional questions concerning the health of the prospective insured, or for applicants beyond a certain age. Each company establishes standard requirements, based on age and amount of coverage, and reserves the right to request additional information and testing, at their own expense.

###### Investigative Consumer Report (Inspection)

To supplement the information on the application, the underwriter may order an inspection report on the applicant from an independent investigating firm or credit agency, which covers financial and moral information. They are general reports of the applicant's finances, character, work, hobbies, and habits. Companies that use inspection reports are subject to the rules and regulations outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

###### Medical Information Bureau (MIB)

In addition to an attending physician's report, the underwriter will usually request the **MIB Report**.

**MIB, Inc.** (formerly known as **the Medical Information Bureau**) is a membership corporation owned by member insurance companies. It is a **nonprofit trade organization**, the purpose of which it is to collect, maintain, and make available to insurance companies important underwriting information on applicants for life and health insurance. It is a systematic method for companies to compare the information they have collected on a potential insured with information other insurers may have discovered. The MIB can be used only as an aid in helping insurers know what areas of impairment they might need to investigate further. An applicant cannot be refused solely because of adverse information discovered through the MIB.

Know This

Insurers cannot refuse coverage solely on the basis of adverse information on an MIB report.

###### Medical Examinations and Lab Tests Including HIV

Medical examinations, when required by the insurance company, are conducted by physicians or paramedics at the insurance company's expense. Usually such exams are not required with regard to health insurance, thus stressing the importance of the agent in recording medical information on the application. The medical exam requirement is more common with life insurance underwriting. If an insurer requests a medical examination, the insurer is responsible for the costs of the exam.

It is common among insurers to require an HIV test when an applicant is applying for a large amount of coverage, or for any increased and additional benefits. To ensure proper obtaining and handling of results, and to protect the insureds' privacy, states have enacted the following laws and regulations for insurers requiring an applicant to submit to an HIV test:

- Prior to testing, the insurer must disclose the use of testing to the applicant, and obtain **written consent** from the applicant on the approved form;
- The insurer must establish written policies and procedures for the internal dissemination of test results among its producers and employees to ensure confidentiality;
- The test must be administered in a manner that meets the protocol of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services;
- The insurer must disclose the test results as authorized by the applicant in writing;
- If the applicant has not identified a physician to receive test results, the positive test results and the identity of the applicant must be sent to the state Department of Health; and
- The reporting of test results must include the name and address of the reporting company.

Requiring an HIV test is not considered unfair discrimination as long as the following conditions are met:

- The testing is required for all individuals in the same class;
- Proposed insured is not denied coverage on the basis of such testing alone (if no other conditions specified in the Insurance Code apply); and
- The tests and testing procedures have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and otherwise comply with applicable state and federal laws.

Insurers are permitted to ask proposed insureds whether they have tested positive on an AIDS-related test.

In New York, **written informed consent** to an HIV-related test must be signed and dated and include the following: a general description and purpose of the test, and a statement that a positive test result is an indication that the individual may develop AIDS and may wish to consider further independent testing. The authorization form may also need to include the person to whom the test results may be disclosed in the event of an adverse underwriting decision (this can be the prospective insured, a physician or other person to be determined by the individual proposed for insurance).

###### Use and Disclosure of Insurance Information

When insurers plan to seek and use information from investigators, they must first provide the applicant/insured with a written Disclosure Authorization Notice. It will state the insurer's practice regarding collection and use of personal information. The disclosure authorization form must be written in plain language, and must be approved by the head of the Department of Insurance.

##### Selection Criteria & Unfair Discrimination

Information the companies obtain relating to risk factors helps the underwriters determine the extent of the risks involved. In order to avoid adverse selection, the company may discriminate in favor of good risks and against poor risks. However, insurance companies cannot unfairly discriminate between individuals of the same class and equal life expectancy in the rates, benefits, or any terms and conditions of the contract.

The following are examples of underwriting practices in life and health insurance that would constitute **unfair discrimination** between **individuals of the same class**:

- Discriminating in policy rates and benefits based solely on
    - Age or gender;
    - Physical or mental impairment;
    - Blindness or partial blindness; or
    - Genetic characteristics or genetic testing.
- Investigating as part of the underwriting process a proposed insured's sexual orientation.

##### Classification of Risks

In classifying a risk, the Home Office underwriting department will look at the applicant’s past medical history, present physical condition, occupation, habits and morals. If the applicant is acceptable, the underwriter must then determine the risk or **rating classification** to be used in deciding whether or not the applicant should pay a higher or lower premium. A prospective insured may be rated as one of the three classifications: **standard, substandard,** or **preferred.**

Know This

The higher the risk, the higher the premium.

###### Standard

**Standard risks** are persons who, according to a company’s underwriting standards, are entitled to insurance protection without extra rating or special restrictions. Standard risks are representative of the majority of people at their age and with similar lifestyles. They are the average risk.

###### Substandard

**Substandard (High Exposure) risk** applicants are not acceptable at standard rates because of physical condition, personal or family history of disease, occupation, or dangerous habits. These policies are also referred to as "rated" because they could be issued with the **premium rated-up**, resulting in a higher premium.

###### Preferred

**Preferred risks** are those individuals who meet certain requirements and qualify for lower premiums than the standard risk. These applicants have superior physical condition, lifestyle, and habits.

###### Declined

Applicants who are rejected are considered **declined risks**. Risks that the underwriters assess as not insurable are declined. _For example_, a risk may be declined for one of the following reasons: 

- There is no insurable interest;
    
- The applicant is medically unacceptable;
    
- The potential for loss is so great it does not meet the definition of insurance; or
    
- Insurance is prohibited by public policy or is illegal.
    

### 3. Premium Determination

Once the company determines that an applicant is insurable, they need to establish an appropriate policy premium. The premium will be used to cover the costs and expenses to keep the policy in force. **Premiums are paid in advance**.

#### Factors in Premium Determination

There are three primary factors that are used in premium determination: risk (mortality - rate of death within a specific group), interest and expense.

##### Mortality

**Mortality** is the ratio of the number of deaths in a specific population over a certain amount of time versus the number of living people in that population. **Mortality tables**, used by insurers, indicate the number of individuals within a specified group of individuals (e.g., males, females, smokers, nonsmokers) starting at a certain age, who are expected to be alive at a succeeding age. In other words, these tables help the insurers predict the expectation of life and the probability of death for a given group.

##### Investment Return

Because premiums are paid before claims are incurred, insurance companies invest a large portion of the premiums in an effort to earn interest on these funds (invested in bonds, stocks, or mortgages). The interest earnings help insurers reduce the premium rates for policyowners.  

##### Expense

The expense factor, also known as the _loading charge,_ also affects premium rates. Insurers have various operating expenses, so each premium must carry a proportionate share of these operating costs. The insurer's largest expense is the commissions paid to its agents. Other ongoing expenses include payroll, rent, and taxes.

#### Premium Concepts

##### Net Single Premium

The **net single premium** includes the mortality and interest components necessary to keep the policy in force until maturity.

**Mortality - Interest = Net Premium**

##### Gross Annual Premium

**Gross annual premium** is the one-year cost for mortality, plus the cost of operating the company (or expense loading). Loading includes commissions, taxes, advertising, and while not an expense, includes the amount added to a pure or basic rate to provide for a profit margin to the insurer.

**Net Premium + Expense (loading) = Gross Premium**

_Example:_

Assume that

|                      |            |                        |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| $500 Mortality cost  |            | $400 Net premium       |
| - $100 Interest      |            | + $200 Operating cost  |
| **$400 Net Premium** | therefore, | **$600 Gross Premium** |

#### Premium Payment Mode

In regard to insurance premiums, _mode_ refers to the **frequency** the policyowner pays the premium. An insurance policy's rates are based on the assumption that the premium will be paid annually at the beginning of the policy year and that the company will have the premium to invest for a full year before paying any claims. If the policyowner chooses to pay the premium more frequently than annually, there will be an additional charge because the company will have additional expenses in billing the premium. However, the premium may be paid annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly.

**Higher Frequency = Higher Premium**

**Monthly > Quarterly > Semi-Annual > Annual**

### 4. Policy Issue and Delivery

Once the underwriting process has been completed and the company issues the policy, the agent will deliver it to the insured. Although personal delivery of the insurance policy is the best method of finalizing the insurance transaction, mailing the policy directly to the policyowner is acceptable. When the insurer relinquishes control of the policy by mailing it to the policyowner, the policy is considered legally delivered. However, it is advisable to obtain a signed **delivery receipt**.

#### Policy Review

Personal delivery of the policy allows the agent an opportunity to make sure that the insured understands all aspects of the contract. Review of the contract with the insured involves pointing out provisions or riders that may be different than anticipated, and explaining what effect they have on the contract. In addition, the agent should explain the rating procedure to the client, especially if the policy is **rated differently** than applied for, or has been modified or amended in any other way. The agent should also explain any other choices and provisions available to the policyowner that may become active at this time.

#### Effective Date of Coverage

**If the initial premium is not paid with the application**, the agent will be required to collect the premium at the time of policy delivery. In this case, the policy does not go into effect until the premium has been collected. The agent may also be required to get a **statement of good health** from the insured. This statement must be signed by the insured, and verifies that the insured has not suffered injury or illness since the application date.

**If the full premium was submitted with the application** and the policy was issued as requested, the policy coverage would generally coincide with the date of application if no medical exam were required. If a medical exam is required, the date of the coverage will coincide with the date of the exam.

Know This

NO premium, NO coverage.

![](https://cdn-content-origin.examfx.com/Images/1957.png)

#### Backdating

Sometimes it is possible to lower the premium rate by **backdating** _(or antedating)_ an application for insurance. If the applicant chooses to do this, the policy may be backdated for no more than **6 months** before the date of the application or the medical examination, whichever is later. All premiums must be paid from the effective date of the policy. The only allowable reason that an application may be backdated is to **effect a lower premium.**
