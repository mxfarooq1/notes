Businesses use life insurance for the same reason individuals use life insurance: it creates an immediate payment upon the death of the insured.

The most common use of life insurance by businesses is as an employee benefit, which serves as a protection for employees and their beneficiaries. There are also other forms of life insurance that can serve business owners and their survivors, and even protect the business itself. These include funding business continuation agreements, compensating executives, and protecting the business against financial loss resulting from the death or disability of key employees.

### 1. Key Person

A business can suffer a financial loss because of the premature death of a key employee – someone who has specialized knowledge, skills or business contacts. A business can lessen the risk of such loss by the use of **key person insurance**. Key person insurance may be issued as term or permanent life, with whole life and universal life policies being used most often.

With this coverage, the **key employee is the insured**, and the business is all of the following:

- Applicant;
- Policyowner;
- Premium payor; and
- Beneficiary.

In the event of death of a key employee, the business would use the money for the additional costs of running the business and replacing the employee. The business cannot take a tax deduction for the expense of the premium. However, if the key employee dies, the benefits paid to the business are usually received tax free. No special agreements or contracts are needed except that the employee(s) would need to give permission for this coverage.

Key person insurance may be term or permanent. An employer may have more than one key person policy.

### 2. Buy-sell Funding

A **buy-sell** agreement is a legal contract that determines what will be done with a business in the event that an owner dies or becomes disabled. This is also referred to as a _business continuation agreement_.

 There are several types of buy-sell agreements that can be used for partnerships and corporations:

- **Cross Purchase** – used in partnerships when each partner buys a policy on the other;
- **Entity Purchase** – used when the partnership buys the policies on the partners;
- **Stock Purchase** – used by privately owned corporations when each stockholder buys a policy on each of the others; and
- **Stock Redemption** – used when the corporation buys one policy on each shareholder.

_Example:_

Here is an example of a cross-purchase buy-sell agreement: Partnership AB has two partners, Partner A and Partner B. The value of the business is $1,000,000. The partners each have an equal interest ($500,000 each). Partner A buys a life policy on Partner B for $500,000, and Partner B buys a life policy on Partner A for $500,000. If Partner A dies, Partner B gets 100% ownership of the business and A's heirs receive $500,000.

### 3. Business Continuation

_Business continuation_ plan is an arrangement between business owners that provides for shares owned by any one of them who dies or becomes disabled to be sold to, and purchased by, the other co-owners or the business.
