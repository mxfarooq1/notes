You will study different types of policies in greater detail later in this course. For the purposes of this chapter, however, you need to understand some basic definitions and characteristics of different classes of life insurance policies.

### 1. Permanent vs. Term

Regarding the length of coverage, all life insurance policies fall into 2 categories: temporary and permanent protection.

**Term** life insurance is _temporary_ life insurance provided for a specific period of time. It is also known as pure life insurance.

**Permanent** life insurance is a general term used to refer to various forms of whole life insurance policies that remain in effect to age 100, as long as the premium is paid. Permanent insurance provides lifetime protection, and includes a savings element (or cash value).

### 2. Participating vs. Nonparticipating

A **participating** **(mutual)** life insurance policy refers to any policy that distributes its dividends to policyowners by cash payments, reduced premiums, units of paid up insurance, a savings program, or by the purchase of term insurance. A **nonparticipating** policy does not pay dividends to the policyowners.

Know This

Only participating policies distribute dividends to policyowners.

### 3. Group vs. Individual

**Individual** life insurance is written on a single life. The rate and coverage are based upon the underwriting of that individual.

**Group** life insurance is written as a master policy covering the lives of more than one individual covered under the single policy. Individuals covered do not receive a policy but instead receive certificates of insurance. The rate and coverage are based upon group underwriting, with all individuals covered for the same amount and rate.

### 4. Fixed vs. Variable

**Fixed** life insurance or annuities are contracts that offer guaranteed minimum or fixed benefits that are stated in the contract. **Variable** life insurance or annuities are contracts in which the cash values accumulate based upon a specific portfolio of stocks without guarantees of performance. Variable annuities keep pace with inflation, and are determined by the value of securities backing it.
