To purchase insurance, the policyowner must face the possibility of losing money or something of value in the event of loss. This is called **insurable interest**. In life insurance, insurable interest must exist between the policyowner and the insured **at the time of application**; however, once a life insurance policy has been issued, the insurer must pay the policy benefit, whether or not an insurable interest exists.

A valid insurable interest may exist between the policyowner and the insured when the policy is insuring any of the following:

1. Policyowner's own life;
2. The life of a family member (a spouse or a close blood relative); or
3. The life of a business partner, key employee, or someone who has a financial obligation to the policyowner (for example, a debtor has a financial obligation to a creditor, so the creditor has a valid insurance interest in the life of the debtor).

Insurable interest is not required of beneficiaries. Since the beneficiary's well-being is dependent upon the insured, and the beneficiary's life is not the one being insured, the beneficiary does not have to show an insurable interest for a policy to be purchased.

Insurable interest must exist at the _time of application_.   The policyowner must have insurable interest in the life of the insured.
