Individuals seeking to buy life insurance may need assistance trying to establish how much coverage is appropriate, based on their ability to pay the premium, serve their needs, and protect their survivors. Insurance companies have developed 2 basic approaches to help producers and buyers to determine the needed amount of protection: human life value approach and needs approach.

### 1. Human Life Value Approach

The **human life value approach (HLVA)** gives the insured an estimate of what would be lost to the family in the event of the premature death of the insured. It calculates an individual’s life value by looking at the insured’s wages, inflation, the number of years until retirement, and the time value of money.

_Example:_

Let’s assume that a 40-year-old insured earns $50,000 a year and is expected to earn the same amount until he retires at age 65. Out of his annual income, $40,000 is spent on family needs, and the remaining $10,000 goes to the insured’s personal expenses. This means that the human life value of this insured to his family is $1,000,000 ($40,000 a year spent on family needs x 25 years to retirement). Based on this assumption, and taking interest and inflation into consideration, the insurance company will determine the right amount of insurance to produce the same annual amount of income for the family if the insured were to die.

### 2. Needs Approach

The needs approach is based on the predicted **needs of a family** after the premature death of the insured. Some of the factors considered by the needs approach are income, the amount of debt (including mortgage), investments, and other ongoing expenses.

#### Determining Lump-sum Needs

Insurance proceeds paid in a lump-sum may be needed for any of the following expenses:

- **Costs Associated with Death (postmortem)** — taking into account the final medical expenses of the insured, funeral expenses, and day-to-day expenses family maintenance;
- **Debt Cancellation (as an alternative to Estate Liquidation)** — paying off debts of the insured such as home mortgage, or auto loans. (Most lenders require a collateral assignment of life insurance as a condition for a loan.);
- **Emergency Reserve Funds** — paying for unexpected expenses following the death of the insured, such as travel expenses and lodging for family members;
- **Education Funds** — paying for children's education expenses so they can remain in school, or for a surviving spouse who may need additional education or training in order to re-enter the job market;
- **Retirement Fund** — as a source of retirement income;
- **Bequests** — leaving funds to the insured’s church, school, or a charity.

#### Planning for Income Needs

Besides taking care of immediate expenses after the death of the insured, the family may need to plan for an income source long term, so the needs approach to life insurance will factor in the following concerns:

- **Replacing Insured’s Salary or Lost Services** — the surviving spouse who was the caregiver of the children may have to train to enter the job market. If the spouse works outside the home, a new expense for day care must be considered.
- **Social Security Income “Blackout” Period** — Social Security blackout period is the time during which the surviving spouse and/or children do not receive any social security survivor benefits. The blackout period begins when the youngest child reaches the age of 16, and ends when the surviving spouse qualifies for retirement benefits, as early as age 60. _(Unmarried children under the age of 18 or up to 19 if they are attending secondary school full time can also receive benefits. Technically, the social security check will be made payable to the surviving spouse until the youngest child is 16, and directly to the child between the ages of 16 and 18.)_
- **Liquidation vs. Retention of Capital** — Under the retention of capital approach, enough insurance is purchased so that when added to other liquid assets, there is enough to pay income benefits without jeopardizing the insured's principal asset (such as a home).
