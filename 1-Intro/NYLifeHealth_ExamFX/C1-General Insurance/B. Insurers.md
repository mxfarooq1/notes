Insurance is available from both private companies and the government. The major difference between government and private insurance is that the government programs are funded with taxes and serve national and state social purposes, while private policies are funded by premiums.

Private insurance companies can be classified in a variety of ways:

- Ownership — stock or mutual;
- Authority to transact business — authorized or unauthorized;
- Location (domicile) — domestic, foreign, and alien;
- Marketing and distribution systems; or
- Rating (financial strength).

As you read about different classifications of insurers, keep in mind that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and the same company can be described based on where it is located and allowed to transact the business of insurance, who owns it, and what type of agents it appoints.

### 1. Types of Insurers

The following are the most common types of ownership.

#### Stock Companies

**Stock companies** are owned by the stockholders who provide the capital necessary to establish and operate the insurance company and who share in any profits or losses. Officers are elected by the stockholders and manage stock insurance companies. Traditionally, stock companies issue **nonparticipating** policies, in which policyowners do not share in profits or losses.

A nonparticipating (stock) policy does not pay dividends to policyowners; however, **taxable dividends are paid to stockholders**. The dividends are not guaranteed as they are based on company profit.

#### Mutual Companies

**Mutual companies** are owned by the policyowners and issue **participating** policies. With participating policies, policyowners are entitled to dividends, which, in the case of mutual companies, are a return of excess premiums and are, therefore, **nontaxable**. Dividends are generated when the premiums and the earnings combined exceed the actual costs of providing coverage, creating a surplus. **Dividends are not guaranteed.**

#### Fraternal Benefit Societies

A **fraternal benefit society** is an organization formed to provide insurance benefits for members of an affiliated lodge, religious organization, or fraternal organization with a representative form of government. Fraternals sell only to their members and are considered charitable institutions, and _not insurers._ They are not subject to all of the regulations that apply to the insurers that offer coverage to the public at large.

In most states, fraternal benefit societies are permitted to issue life insurance (including endowments), health insurance (including medical and disability), and annuities. They do not issue property or liability policies.  

### 2. Private vs. Government Insurers

Federal and state governments provide insurance in the areas where private insurance is not available, called **social insurance programs**. Government insurance programs include Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Crop insurance and National Flood insurance.

The major difference between government programs and private insurance programs is that the government programs are funded with taxes and serve national and state social purposes, while private policies are funded by premiums.

### 3. Admitted vs. Nonadmitted Insurers

Before insurers may transact business in a specific state, they must apply for and be granted a license or **Certificate of Authority** from the state department of insurance and meet any financial (capital and surplus) requirements set by the state. Insurers who meet the state's financial requirements and are approved to transact business in the state are considered **authorized or admitted** into the state as a legal insurer. Those insurers who have not been approved to do business in the state are considered **unauthorized or** **nonadmitted**. Most states have laws that prohibit unauthorized insurers from conducting business in the state, except through licensed excess and surplus lines brokers.

Know This

Insurers must obtain a Certificate of Authority prior to transacting business in this state.

### 4. Domestic, Foreign and Alien Insurers

Insurance companies are classified according to the **location of incorporation** (domicile). Regardless of where an insurance company is incorporated, it must obtain a Certificate of Authority before transacting insurance within the state.

Know This

A _domicile_ refers to the location where an insurer is incorporated, not necessarily where the insurer conducts business.

A **domestic** insurer is an insurance company that is incorporated in this state. In most cases, the company's home office is in the state in which it was formed — the company's domicile. _For instance,_ a company chartered in Pennsylvania would be considered a Pennsylvania domestic company.

A **foreign** insurer is an insurance company that is incorporated in another state, the District of Columbia, or a territorial possession. The United States has 5 major U.S. territories: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

_For example,_ a company chartered in California would be a foreign insurer within the state of New York. A company chartered in Puerto Rico will be foreign in any U.S. state.

An **alien** insurer is an insurance company that is incorporated outside the United States.

### 5. Financial Status (Independent Rating Services)

The financial strength and stability of an insurance company are two vitally important factors to potential insureds. The financial strength of an insurance company is based on prior claims experience, investment earnings, level of reserves (amount of money kept in a separate account to cover debts to policyholders), and management, to name a few. Guides to insurance companies' financial integrity are published regularly by the following various independent rating services:

- AM Best
    
- Fitch
    
- Standard and Poor's
    
- Moody's
    
- Weiss
    

### 6. Marketing (Distribution) Systems

Insurance companies market their products in different ways: through agents or direct solicitation to the customers.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**TYPE OF MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS**|**CHARACTERISTICS**|
|**Independent Agency System/  <br>American Agency System**|- One independent agent represents several companies<br>- Nonexclusive<br>- Commissions on personal sales<br>- Business renewal with any company|

### 7. Reinsurance: Insurance for Insurers

**Reinsurance** is a contract under which one insurance company (the reinsurer) indemnifies another insurance company for part or all of its liabilities. The purpose of reinsurance is to protect insurers against catastrophic losses. The originating company that procures insurance on itself from another insurer is called the _ceding insurer_ (because it cedes, or gives, the risk to the reinsurer). The other insurer is called the _assuming insurer_, or reinsurer.
