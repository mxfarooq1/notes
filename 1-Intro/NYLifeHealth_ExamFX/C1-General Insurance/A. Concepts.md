Insurance is a **transfer** of risk of loss from an individual or a business entity to an insurance company, which, in turn, spreads the costs of unexpected losses to many individuals. If there were no insurance mechanism, the cost of a loss would have to be borne solely by the individual who suffered the loss.

Insurance is the _transfer of risk_ of loss. The cost of an insured's loss is transferred over to the insurer and spread among other insureds.

### 1. Risk Management Key Terms

#### Risk

**Risk** is the uncertainty or chance of a loss occurring. The two types of risks are pure and speculative, only one of which is insurable.

- **Pure risk** refers to situations that can only result in a loss or no change. There is no opportunity for financial gain. Pure risk is the only type of risk that insurance companies are willing to accept.
- **Speculative risk** involves the opportunity for either loss or gain. An example of speculative risk is gambling. These types of risks are not insurable.

Know This

Only _pure_ risks are insurable.

#### Hazard

**Hazards** are conditions or situations that increase the probability of an insured loss occurring. Conditions such as slippery floors, or congested traffic are hazards and may increase the chance of a loss occurring. Hazards are classified as physical hazards, moral hazards; or morale hazards.

- **Physical** hazards are those arising from the material, structural, or operational features of the risk, apart from the persons owning or managing it.
- **Moral** hazards refer to those applicants that may lie on an application for insurance, or in the past, have submitted fraudulent claims against an insurer.
- **Morale** hazard refers to an increase in the hazard presented by a risk, arising from the insured's indifference to loss because of the existence of insurance.  
    

#### Peril

**Perils** are the **causes** of loss insured against in an insurance policy.

- _Life insurance_ insures against the financial loss caused by the premature death of the insured;
- _Health insurance_ insures against the medical expenses and/or loss of income caused by the insured’s sickness or accidental injury;
- _Property insurance_ insures against the loss of physical property or the loss of its income-producing abilities;
- _Casualty insurance_ insures against the loss and/or damage of property and resulting liabilities.

#### Loss

**Loss** is defined as the reduction, decrease, or disappearance of value of the person or property insured in a policy, caused by a named peril. Insurance provides a means to transfer loss.

#### Exposure

**Exposure** is a unit of measure used to determine rates charged for insurance coverage. In life insurance, all of the following factors are considered in determining rates:

- The age of the insured;
- Medical history;
- Occupation; and
- Sex.

A large number of units having the same or similar exposure to loss is known as **homogeneous**. The basis of insurance is sharing risk among the members of a large homogeneous group with similar exposure to loss.

Know This

A risk is a _chance_ that a loss will occur; a hazard increases the _probability of loss_; a peril is the _cause_ of loss.

### 2. Methods of Handling Risk

#### Avoidance

One of the methods of dealing with risk is **avoidance**, which means eliminating exposure to a loss. _For example,_ if a person wanted to avoid the risk of dying in an airplane crash, they might choose never to fly in an airplane. Risk avoidance is effective, but seldom practical.

#### Retention

Risk **retention** is the planned assumption of risk by an insured through the use of deductibles, co-payments, or self-insurance. It is also known as self-insurance when the insured accepts the responsibility for the loss before the insurance company pays. The purpose of retention is

1. To reduce expenses and improve cash flow;
2. To increase control of claim reserving and claims settlements; and
3. To have funds for losses that cannot be insured.

#### Sharing

**Sharing** is a method of dealing with risk for a group of individual persons or businesses with the same or similar exposure to loss to share the losses that occur within that group. A reciprocal insurance exchange is a formal risk-sharing arrangement.

#### Reduction

Since we usually cannot avoid risk entirely, we often attempt to lessen the possibility or severity of a loss. **Reduction** would include actions such as installing smoke detectors in our homes, having an annual physical to detect health problems early, or perhaps making a change in our lifestyles.

#### Transfer

The most effective way to handle risk is to **transfer** it so that the loss is borne by another party. Insurance is the most common method of transferring risk from an individual or group to an insurance company. Though the purchasing of insurance will not eliminate the risk of death or illness, it relieves the insured of the financial losses these risks bring.

There are several ways to transfer risk, such as hold harmless agreements and other contractual agreements, but the safest and most common method is to purchase insurance coverage.

### 3. Elements of Insurable Risks

Not all risks are insurable. As noted earlier, insurers will insure only **pure risks,** or those that involve only the chance of loss with no chance of gain. Furthermore, even pure risks must have certain characteristics in order to be insurable. Insurable risks involve the following characteristics:

- **Due to chance —** A loss that is outside the insured’s control.
- **Definite and measurable —** A loss that is specific as to the cause, time, place and amount. An insurer must be able to determine how much the benefit will be and when it becomes payable.
- **Statistically predictable —** Insurers must be able to estimate the average frequency and severity of future losses and set appropriate premium rates. (In life and health insurance, the use of mortality tables and morbidity tables allows the insurer to project losses based on statistics.)
- **Not catastrophic —** Insurers need to be reasonably certain their losses will not exceed specific limits. That is why insurance policies usually exclude coverage for loss caused by war or nuclear events: There is no statistical data that allows for the development of rates that would be necessary to cover losses from events of this nature.
- **Randomly selected and large loss exposure —** There must be a sufficiently large pool of the insured that represents a random selection of risks in terms of age, gender, occupation, health and economic status, and geographic location.

### 4. Adverse Selection

Insurance companies strive to protect themselves from **adverse selection,** the insuring of risks that are more prone to losses than the average risk. Poorer risks tend to seek insurance or file claims to a greater extent than better risks.

To protect themselves from adverse selection, insurance companies have an option to refuse or restrict coverage for bad risks, or charge them a higher rate for insurance coverage.

### 5. Law of Large Numbers

The basis of insurance is sharing risk among a large pool of people with a similar exposure to loss (a homogeneous group). The **law of large numbers** states that the larger the number of people with a similar exposure to loss, the more predictable actual losses will be. This law forms the basis for statistical prediction of loss upon which insurance rates are calculated.

_Example:_

When an insurance company issues a policy on a 35-year-old male, the company really has no way of knowing or accurately predicting when he will die. However, the Law of Large Numbers looks at a large group of similar risks – 35-year-old males of similar lifestyles and health conditions – and makes some conclusions based on statistics of past losses. This allows the insurance company to have a general idea about the predicted time of death for this type of insured and to set the premiums accordingly.

Know This

As the number of people in a risk pool increases, future losses become more predictable.
