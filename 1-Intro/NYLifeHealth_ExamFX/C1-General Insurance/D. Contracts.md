A **_contract_** is an agreement between two or more parties enforceable by law. Because of unique aspects of insurance transactions, the general law of contracts had to be modified to meet the needs of insurance.

### 1. Elements of a Legal Contract

In order for insurance contracts to be legally binding, they must have 4 essential elements:

1. Agreement — offer and acceptance;
2. Consideration;
3. Competent parties; and
4. Legal purpose.

#### Offer and Acceptance

There must be a definite offer by one party, and the other party must accept this offer in its exact terms. In insurance, the applicant usually makes the **offer** when submitting the application. **Acceptance** takes place when an insurer’s underwriter approves the application and issues a policy.

#### Consideration

The binding force in any contract is the **consideration**. Consideration is something of value that each party gives to the other. The consideration on the part of the insured is the payment of premium and the representations made in the application. The consideration on the part of the insurer is the promise to pay in the event of loss.

Know This

_Insurer's consideration_ is the promise to pay for losses; _insured's consideration_ is the payment of premium and statements on the application.

#### Competent Parties

The parties to a contract must be capable of entering into a contract in the eyes of the law. Generally, this requires that both parties be of legal age (14 1/2 in New York), mentally competent to understand the contract, and not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

#### Legal Purpose

The purpose of the contract must be **legal** and not against public policy. To ensure legal purpose of a Life Insurance policy, for example, it must have both: insurable interest and consent. A contract without a legal purpose is considered void, and cannot be enforced by any party.

### 2. Characteristics of Insurance Contracts

In addition to required elements, insurance contracts have unique characteristics that distinguish them from other types of legal contracts. It is important to understand these features and how they affect parties to an insurance contract.

Know This

Aleatory = _unequal_ values;  
Unilateral = _one-sided_ (only one party makes a promise)  
Adhesion = only _one party_ (insurer) prepares a contract, and the other party (insured) accepts it as is

#### Contract of Adhesion

A **_contract of adhesion_** is prepared by one of the parties (insurer) and accepted or rejected by the other party (insured). Insurance policies are not drawn up through negotiations, and an insured has little to say about its provisions. In other words, insurance contracts are offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis by an insurer. Any ambiguities in the contract will be settled in favor of the insured.

#### Aleatory Contract

Insurance contracts are **aleatory_,_** which means there is an exchange of unequal amounts or values. The premium paid by the insured is small in relation to the amount that will be paid by the insurer in the event of loss.

_Life and Health Example:_

John purchases a life insurance policy for $100,000. His monthly premium is $100. If John only had the policy for 2 months, which means he only paid $200 in premiums, and he unexpectedly died, his beneficiary will receive $100,000. A $200 contribution on the part of the insured in exchange for $100,000 benefit from the insurer illustrates an aleatory contract.

_Property and Casualty Example:_

John purchases a homeowners insurance policy for $100,000. His monthly premium is $100. If John only had the policy for 2 months, which means he only paid $200 in premiums, and the home was unexpectedly destroyed by a covered peril, John will receive $100,000. A $200 contribution on the part of the insured in exchange for $100,000 benefit from the insurer illustrates an aleatory contract.

#### Personal Contract

In general, an insurance contract is a **personal contract** because it is between the insurance company and an individual. Because the company has a right to decide with whom it will and will not do business, the insured cannot be changed to someone else without the written consent of the insurer, nor can the owner transfer the contract to another person without the insurer's approval. Life insurance is an exception to this rule: A policyowner can transfer (or assign) ownership to another person. However, the insurer must still be notified in writing.

#### Unilateral Contract

In a **unilateral contract,** only one of the parties to the contract is legally bound to do anything. The insured makes no legally binding promises. However, an insurer is legally bound to pay losses covered by a policy in force.

#### Conditional Contract

As the name implies, a **conditional contract** requires that certain conditions must be met by the policyowner and the company in order for the contract to be executed, and before each party fulfills its obligations. _For example_, the insured must pay the premium and provide proof of loss in order for the insurer to cover a claim.

### 3. Legal Concepts and Interpretations Affecting Contracts

#### Ambiguities in a Contract of Adhesion

Because only the insurance company has the right to draw up a contract, and the insured has to adhere to the contract as issued, the courts have held that any ambiguity in the contract should be interpreted **in favor of the insured**.

#### Indemnity

**Indemnity** (sometimes referred to as **reimbursement**) is a provision in an insurance policy that states that in the event of loss, an insured or a beneficiary is permitted to collect only to the extent of the financial loss, and is not allowed to gain financially because of the existence of an insurance contract. The purpose of insurance is to restore, but not let an insured or a beneficiary profit from the loss.

_Life and Health Example:_

Brenda has a health insurance policy for $20,000. After she was hospitalized, her medical expenses added up to $15,000. The insurance policy will reimburse Brenda only for $15,000 (the amount of the loss), and not for $20,000 (the total amount of insurance).

_Property and Casualty Example:_

Brenda has a homeowners insurance policy for $200,000. After her home was destroyed, her expense to rebuild the home added up to $150,000. The insurance policy will reimburse Brenda only for $150,000 (the amount of the loss), and not for $200,000 (the total amount of insurance).

Know This

Indemnity means insureds cannot recover more than their loss.

#### Utmost Good Faith

The principle of **utmost good faith** implies that there will be no fraud, misrepresentation or concealment between the parties. As it pertains to insurance policies, both the insurer and insured must be able to rely on the other for relevant information. The insured is expected to provide accurate information on the application for insurance, and the insurer must clearly and truthfully describe policy features and benefits, and must not conceal or mislead the insured.

#### Representations and Misrepresentations

**Representations** are statements believed to be true to the best of one's knowledge, but they are not guaranteed to be true. For insurance purposes, representations are the answers the insured gives to the questions on the insurance application.

Untrue statements on the application are considered **misrepresentations** and could void the contract. A **material misrepresentation** is a statement that, if discovered, would alter the underwriting decision of the insurance company. Furthermore, if material misrepresentations are **intentional**, they are considered fraud.

Know This

Representations are statements _believed to be true._ Insured's statements on the application are _representations_.

#### Warranties

A **warranty** is an absolutely true statement upon which the validity of the insurance policy depends. Breach of warranties can be considered grounds for voiding the policy or a return of premium. Because of such a strict definition, statements made by applicants for life and health insurance policies, for example, are usually not considered warranties, except in cases of fraud.

#### Rescission

When an insurance applicant intentionally fails to communicate information that the insurer needs, the insurer has the right to cancel the policy even if the failure to communicate is discovered after the policy has been issued. This act is called **rescission**, and the insurer is said to have **rescinded** the policy.

Upon rescission, the policyowner loses any right to file a claim on the policy, and the insurer refunds all money paid.

#### Concealment

**Concealment** is the legal term for the intentional withholding of information of a material fact that is crucial in making a decision. In insurance, concealment is the withholding of information by the applicant that will result in an imprecise underwriting decision. Concealment may void a policy.

#### Fraud

**Fraud** is the intentional misrepresentation or intentional concealment of a material fact used to induce another party to make or refrain from making a contract, or to deceive or cheat a party. Fraud is grounds for voiding an insurance contract.

#### Waiver and Estoppel

**Waiver** is the voluntary act of relinquishing a legal right, claim or privilege.

**Estoppel** is a legal process that can be used to prevent a party to a contract from re-asserting a right or privilege after that right or privilege has been waived. Estoppel is a legal consequence of a waiver.

### 4. Readability Requirements

In the state of New York, all insurance policies and contracts must be written in clear and coherent manner, and use words with common and everyday meanings to facilitate readability. The text must be printed in at least 10-point type (except for specification pages, schedules and tables).
