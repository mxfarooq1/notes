The term **life settlement** refers to any financial transaction in which the owner of a life insurance policy sells a life insurance policy to a third party for some form of compensation, usually cash. A life settlement would require an absolute assignment of all rights to the policy from the original policyowner to the new policyowner.

Policyowners may choose to sell their policies because they feel they no longer need their coverage, or the premium costs have grown too high to justify continuation of the policy. In many cases, however, life settlement transactions are offered to senior citizens who may have a life-threatening illness and a short life expectancy. In these situations, the owner may elect to sell the policy to a life settlement provider for an amount greater than what they would receive if they surrendered the policy for cash value.

_Example:_

A person, age 70, owns a $1,000,000 life insurance policy. He recently sold his business for $5,000,000 and decided he no longer needed the insurance coverage. The cash value is $390,000, which the insurance company would give the policyowner if he cashed in the policy. A life settlement provider may offer him, after reviewing his medical records, $575,000 for the policy. Once ownership is transferred and the policyowner has received the funds, the life settlement company will assume premium payments until the insured dies, at which time the life settlement company will receive the proceeds of the policy - $1,000,000.

Know This

In a life settlement, the owner sells an existing life policy to a third party.

The term **business of life settlement** refers to **any** activity relating to the solicitation and sale of an insurance policy to a third party who has no insurable interest in the insured (i.e. soliciting, negotiating, effectuating, monitoring or tracking life settlement contracts).

The term **owner** refers to the owner of the policy who may seek to enter into a life settlement contract.

**Life expectancy** is an important concept in life settlement contracts. It refers to a calculation based on the average number of months the insured is projected to live due to medical history and mortality factors.

**Life settlement contract** establishes the terms under which the life settlement provider will pay compensation to the policyowner, in return for the assignment, transfer, sale, or release of any portion of any of the following:

- The death benefit;
- Policy ownership;
- Any beneficial interest; or
- Interest in a trust or any other entity that owns the policy.

Life settlement providers may not use any life settlement contract unless the form of the contract, the application, and any other form that is required by regulations, have been filed with and approved by the Superintendent of Financial Services. The Superintendent may later withdraw the approval if it is discovered that the contract contains provisions that are unjust, unfair, or inequitable.

The following **would not constitute** a Life Settlement:

- Assignment of a life policy as collateral for a loan (that will not be used for premium payments);
- A policy loan;
- Surrender of an insurance policy;
- A 1035 exchange;
- Assignment of a life policy to an individual;
- An agreement to assign a contract that is already a policy that has been acquired by a life settlement provider (a settled policy);
- An agreement between parties closely related to the insured by blood or law;
- Employer-owned life insurance on key employees;
- Other forms of legitimate business insurance;
- Any other form of agreement determined similar to any of the above by the Superintendent.

**Life settlement broker** is a person who, for _compensation_, solicits, negotiates, or offers to negotiate a life settlement contract. Life settlement brokers represent only the policyowners, and have a fiduciary duty to the owners to act according to their instructions and in their best interest. 

This does not include a licensed life settlement provider or its representative, an attorney, an accountant, or a financial planner. This category includes persons who would not receive a commission upon completion of a life settlement contract, but charge a fee for their services, whether or not ownership of the policy is transferred.

**Financing transaction** takes place when a licensed settlement provider obtains funds from the financing entity. _Financing entity_ includes any accredited investor who provides funds for the purchase of one or more life settlement contracts and who has an agreement in writing to do so.
