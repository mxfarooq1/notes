**Stranger-originated life insurance** **(STOLI)** is a life insurance arrangement in which a person with no relationship to the insured (a "stranger") purchases a life policy on the insured's life with the intent of selling the policy to an investor and profiting financially when the insured dies. In other words, STOLIs are financed and purchased solely with the intent of selling them for life settlements.

STOLIs **violate the principle of insurable interest**, which is in place to ensure that a person purchasing a life insurance policy is actually interested in the longevity rather than the death of the insured. Because of this, insurers take an aggressive legal stance against policies they suspect are involved in STOLI transactions.

Note that lawful life settlement contracts do not constitute STOLIs. Life settlement transactions result from existing life insurance policies; STOLIs are initiated for the purpose of obtaining a policy that would benefit a person who has no insurable interest in the life of the insured at the time of policy origination.

The state of New York does not allow direct or indirect participation in STOLIs.

**Trust-owned policies:** It is also illegal to use a trust, directly or indirectly, to provide funds for a STOLI transaction in a manner that violates insurable interest laws of this state.
