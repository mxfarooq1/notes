Before a person can act as a life settlement broker in this state, the person must be properly licensed. The following are the required qualifications for a licensee: 

- Be at least 18 years old;
- Submit an application to the Superintendent on the approved form;
- Be determined competent and trustworthy by the Superintendent;
- Complete required prelicensing education;
- Pass the licensing exam;
- Pay any required fees; and
- Submit fingerprints.

If a **firm or association** is applying for a broker's license, they must name and authorize natural persons to act individually as life settlement brokers for the firm.

If a **life producer** has maintained an active license for one year, the prelicensing class and exam, as well as fingerprinting, may be waived when applying for a life settlement broker license. The Superintendent may refuse to issue a life settlement broker's license if the applicant is deemed not trustworthy or has failed to comply with any licensing requirements.

If a life settlement broker's license is active, but has been **lost or destroyed**, the Superintendent may issue a replacement license. Prior to that, however, the broker must file a written application for such license, affirming under penalty of perjury that the original license has been lost or destroyed. A $15 fee will also be required.
