**Required provisions** that apply to annuities are the same as those that apply to life insurance contracts (Review the following required provisions: _grace period, incontestability, entire contract, misstatement of age, free-look period,_ and other life insurance provisions).

The following are additional required provisions that apply to annuities:

- For every annuity (except those paid for by a single premium), if the contract has been in force for 3 years and lapses or becomes defaulted because payment to the insurer has not been made, the insurer, after deducting a surrender charge and any indebtedness, can apply the balance as a net single-premium for the purchase of a paid-up annuity.
- Annuities must be offered with nonforfeiture benefits under defaulted contracts: in the event of default in payment of a premium, after an annuity contract has been in force for 3 full years, the insurer must pay a cash surrender value to the person entitled within 3 months.
- Insurers will provide a statement of the mortality table (if any) and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, the times at which such guaranteed benefits are payable (along with sufficient information to determine the amounts of such benefit), and whether the contract provides for the determination of any cash surrender value in accordance with a market-value adjustment formula that has been filed with the Superintendent. _Market-value adjustment formulas_ are those described in the contract that increase and decrease the actual accumulation amount in order to determine cash surrender values payable.
- For annuities other than single premium, paid-up contracts, the insurer will mail to the contract holder a statement regarding any paid-up annuity benefit, any cash surrender benefit, and any death benefit.
