This chapter explained key concepts related to annuities, from the parties to the contract to different annuity classifications. Let’s recap the main concepts you need to know:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**ANNUITIES**|   |
|**Phases**|- _Accumulation period -_ payments in, to insurer<br>- _Annuitization period -_ payments out, to insured|
|**Parties**|- _Annuitant -_ insured; policy issued on annuitant's life; must be a person<br>- _Beneficiary -_ will receive any amount contributed to annuity (plus any gain) if annuitant dies during accumulation period<br>- _Owner -_ has all rights to policy (usually annuitant); can be corporation or trust|
|**Types of Annuities**|- _Fixed Annuities -_ guaranteed, fixed payment amount; premiums in general account<br>- _Variable Annuities - p_ayment not guaranteed; premiums are in separate account, and invested in stocks and bonds<br>- _Indexed Annuities -_ interest rate tied to an index; earn higher rate than fixed annuities, not as risky as variable annuities or mutual funds|
|**Premium Payments**|- _Single -_ ONE lump-sum payment. The principal is created immediately (used for both immediate and deferred annuities).<br>- _Periodic (level or flexible) -_ multiple payments; annuity principal fund is created over time (used for deferred annuity only)|
|**Income Payments**|- _Immediate -_ purchased with a single premium. Income payments start within one year of the date of purchase.<br>- _Deferred -_ purchased with either lump sum or periodic-payments premium. Benefits start sometime after one year from the date of purchase (often used to accumulate funds for retirement).|
|**Settlement Options**|- _Lump-sum -_ at annuitization; all interest accumulated is taxable; additional 10% penalty can be imposed prior to annuitant's reaching 59 1/2.<br>- _Life Only -_ insured cannot outlive income. Any monies not paid out are retained by company at insured's death. Pays highest monthly amount.<br>- _Refund Life Annuity -_ guaranteed lifetime income. If the annuitant dies, the balance is "refunded" to the beneficiary. The installment refund option pays the beneficiary until the purchase amount is paid out. The cash refund option refunds the balance of the original annuity purchase amount minus payments made to the annuitant.<br>- _Joint Life -_ 2 or more annuitants receive payments until first death, then payments cease.<br>- _Joint and Survivor -_ income for 2 or more that cannot be outlived. Often used with period certain. When one annuitant dies, the other receives either 1/2 or 2/3 of the original payment amount.<br>- _Life with Period Certain -_ specific monthly payment for life and a specific period of time (e.g., Life plus 10-year certain). If the annuitant dies before the payment period is up, the payment goes to beneficiary.<br>- _Annuities Certain -_ payments guaranteed for a fixed period or until a certain fixed amount is paid out. NO LIFE option. <br>- Any unpaid annuity benefits following the death of an annuitant are taxable when paid to the beneficiary.|
|**Interest Rate**|- _Guaranteed -_ company must pay this minimum percentage (usually, 3%).<br>- _Current -_ exceeds guaranteed rate. Paid to the annuitant when the company's own investment is better than expected.|
