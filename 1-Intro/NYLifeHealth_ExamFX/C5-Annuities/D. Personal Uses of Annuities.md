The principal use of an annuity is to provide income for **retirement**; however, an annuity may be used for any accumulation of cash or simply to liquidate an estate. Because of the various uses of annuities, agents should always assess how well a recommended product will meet the applicant's needs and resources — the **suitability** of a product.

The main use of annuities is to provide retirement income.

### 1. Lump-Sum Settlements

Annuities may serve as an ideal financial vehicle for someone who comes into a large lump sum of money, such as inheritance, lottery, award of damages from a lawsuit, proceeds from a sale of a business, or a lump-sum distribution from a qualified pension plan. In this case, a person may purchase a **single premium immediate annuity**, which will convert the lump sum into a series of periodic payments, providing a stream of income for the annuitant.

### 2. Retirement Income

Since annuities are a popular means to provide retirement income, they are often used to fund **qualified retirement plans**, which means they meet the IRS guidelines to receive favorable tax treatment.

Qualified retirement annuities can be **individual** (such as individual retirement accounts — IRAs), and **group** (such as tax-sheltered annuity — TSA, or profit-sharing pension plans).

#### Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit

Retirement annuities may offer a **Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit** (GMWB) option to the annuitant. With this option, the annuitant can withdraw a maximum percentage of their investment annually until the initial investment has been recovered. This option protects the annuitant against investment losses.

### 3. Education Funds

In addition to providing income for retirement and estate liquidation, annuities can be used to accumulate funds for college education. An annuity can provide savings on a tax-deferred basis for the education expenses of the annuitant.
