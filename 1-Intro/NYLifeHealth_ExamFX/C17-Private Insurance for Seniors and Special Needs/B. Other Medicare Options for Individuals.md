### 1. Disabled Individuals

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA) requires that large group health plans (100 employees or more) must provide primary coverage for **disabled individuals** under age 65 who are not retired.

### 2. Individuals with Kidney Failure

As amended by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, OBRA also requires the employer health plan to provide primary coverage for **30 months** for individuals with end-stage renal (kidney) disease before Medicare becomes primary.

### 3. Employer Group Health Plans

#### Employees Age 65 or Older

If an employee is still employed upon reaching age 65, federal laws require allowing the employee to remain on the group health insurance rolls and to defer Medicare coverage until retirement. The employee has the right to reject the company's plan and elect Medicare, but the company can offer no incentives for switching to Medicare.

If an employee remains on the group plan and signs up for Medicare, in groups of fewer than 20 employees, Medicare will be the primary coverage. In groups of 20 or more, the **group coverage will be primary** over Medicare.

Know This

Anyone over the age of 65 may choose to either keep the employer's group health coverage or elect coverage through Medicare.
