### 1. Newborn Child Coverage

Any family coverage must provide coverage for newborns **from the moment of birth**. This includes newborns adopted by the insured, if the insured takes physical custody of the infant upon the infant's release from the hospital.

Newborns are covered for injury or sickness including the necessary care and treatment of medically diagnosed congenital defects and birth abnormalities including premature birth (except in cases of adoption). Coverage of the initial hospital stay is not required if a natural parent has insurance coverage available for the infant's care.

If notification and/or payment of an additional premium or contribution is required to make coverage effective for a newborn infant, the coverage may provide that notice and/or payment be made within at least **30 days** of the day of birth to make coverage effective from the moment of birth. This provision must include 48 hours of hospitalization coverage for natural childbirth and 96 hours for caesarian delivery.

### 2. Dependent Child Age Limit

As defined by the Insurance Laws of New York, the term _dependent children_ includes any children under a specified age.

Know that the Affordable Care Act mandates that every insurer that offers health insurance policies that provide coverage for dependent children of the insured must provide that coverage for the children **up to the age of 26.**

**Group health policies** that provide coverage for dependents of the insured must cover any married and unmarried children of the insured until the **age of 26**, regardless of financial dependence, residency, student status, or employment. Coverage may be extended to age 29 for unmarried children if requested by the policyholder.

### 3. Policy Extensions for Handicapped Children

There are policy extensions for unmarried dependent children, regardless of age, who are incapable of self-sustaining employment because of mental illness, developmental disability, mental retardation (as defined in the mental hygiene law) or physical handicap. Coverage will not end as long as the policy stays in force and the dependent child remains in this condition.

The dependent child must have become incapable prior to the attainment of the limiting age, and the policyholder must have submitted proof of the dependent's incapacity **within 31 days** of the day the notice of termination of coverage is sent to the policyholder.
