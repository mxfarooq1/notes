Health care insurers (carriers) include stock and mutual insurance companies, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). Care is administered not only in the doctors' offices or the hospital but also in surgicenters, urgent care centers, and skilled nursing facilities.

### 1. Major Medical Insurance (Indemnity Plans)

Major medical expense policies were a natural outgrowth of basic medical expense policies. Since basic medical expense policies had low dollar limits of protection, the need for a more comprehensive form of protection was realized and provided in the form of major medical policies. Typically, a major medical policy provides a substantial dollar amount of protection, usually $1,000,000, but that amount could be more or less depending on the company writing the policy. New York sets the following minimal limitations for a major medical company:

1. No less than a $100,000 benefit;
2. Coinsurance cannot exceed 25%; and
3. Deductibles not to exceed 5% of one above or basic coverage benefits, if greater.

#### Characteristics

Major medical expense contracts are characterized by high maximum limits, blanket coverage, coinsurance, and a deductible. Dollar deductibles are paid up front, and the coinsurance, or sharing of the cost, is paid after the deductible is met and the claim is submitted.

#### Common Limitations

Generally, most major medical plans cover most medical expenses in and out of the hospital, and they have high maximum benefit limits. These plans are called covered or eligible expense plans.

#### Exclusions from Coverage

The following are among the **exclusions** found in major medical insurance policies:

- Injuries caused by war;
- Intentionally self-inflicted injuries;
- Regular dental/vision/hearing care;
- Custodial care;
- Injuries covered by workers compensation insurance; and
- Cosmetic surgery (unless necessitated by a birth defect or an accident).

#### Provisions Affecting Cost to Insureds

Major medical policy premiums vary depending on the amount of the deductible, the coinsurance percentage, the stop-loss amount and the maximum amount of the benefit.

Most companies incorporate an annual **deductible** into their major medical policy. A typical deductible could range from $100 to $2,500. The deductible amount is the portion of medical expenses that are paid by the insured each year before the insurance benefits start. The higher the deductible, the lower the annual premium for the coverage will be. In other words, if you accept more risk through a higher deductible, the insurance company lowers your premium.

Know This

Higher deductible = lower premium.

Once the deductible has been met, the insured and the insurance company share the following expenses in what is called **coinsurance**. Generally the insurance company pays the larger share of 90/10, 80/20, or 70/30, or can also pay an equal share of 50/50. The smaller the percentage that the insurance company pays, the less the premium will be. Coinsurance helps keep costs down by requiring the insured’s participation in the ongoing expense.

Many insurance companies include a **stop-loss feature** in their major medical policies. The stop-loss amount would be the amount that the insured pays out of pocket during the year. When the insured’s out-of-pocket expenses reach the stop-loss, the insurance company then provides coverage at 100% of eligible expenses for the remainder of the year. The out-of-pocket expenses that qualify for the stop-loss would be the insured’s portion of the coinsurance and it may or may not include the deductible. The higher the stop-loss, the lower the premium will be.

### 2. Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)

By means of the Health Maintenance Act of 1973, Congress strongly supported the growth of **health maintenance organizations** (HMOs) in this country. The act forced employers with more than 25 employees to offer the HMO as an alternative to their regular health plans. (The part of the act requiring dual choice has expired and has not been reenacted).

#### General Characteristics

The HMO provides benefits in the form of **services** rather than in the form of reimbursement for the services of the physician or hospital. Traditionally, the insurance companies provide the financing, while the doctors and hospitals have provided the care. The HMO concept is unique in that the HMO provides both the financing and patient care for its members.

##### Limited Service Area

The HMO offers services to those living within **specific geographic boundaries**, such as county lines or city limits. If individuals live within those boundaries, they are eligible to belong to the HMO, but if they do not live within the boundaries, they are ineligible.

##### Limited Choice of Providers

The HMO tries to limit costs by only providing care from physicians that meet their standards and are willing to provide care at a prenegotiated price.

##### Copayments

A copayment is a specific part of the cost of care or a flat dollar amount that must be paid by the member. _For example,_ the member may be required to pay $5, $10 or $25 for each office visit.

There is usually no deductible required under HMO plans.

##### Prepaid Basis

HMOs operate on a _capitated_ basis: the HMO receives a flat amount each month attributed to each member, whether the member sees a physician or not. In essence, it is a prepaid medical plan. Plan members receive all of the services necessary from the member physicians and hospitals.

#### Preventive Care Services

The main goal of the HMO Act was to reduce the cost of health care by utilizing **preventive care**. While most insurance plans offered no benefits for preventive care prior to 1973, HMOs offer free annual check-ups for the entire family. In this way, the HMOs hope to catch diseases in the earliest stages, when treatment has the greatest chance for success. The HMOs also offer free or low-cost immunizations to members in an effort to prevent certain diseases.

Know This

The main focus for an HMO is preventive care.

#### Primary Care Physicians (PCP) vs. Referral (Specialty) Physician

Care is provided to members of the HMO by a limited number of physicians that are approved to practice in the HMO.

##### Primary Care Physician (PCP)

When an individual becomes a member of the HMO, they will choose their **primary care physician (PCP)** or **gatekeeper.** Once chosen, the primary care physician or HMO will be regularly compensated for being responsible for the care of that member, whether care is provided or not. It should be in the primary care physician's best interest to keep this member healthy to prevent the need for treatment of diseases in the future.

##### Referral (Specialty) Physician

In order for the member to get to see a specialist, the primary care physician (gatekeeper) must refer the member. The referral system keeps the member away from higher priced specialists unless it is truly necessary. In many HMOs, there is a financial cost to the primary care physician for referring a patient to the more expensive specialist, thus the primary care physician may be inclined to use an alternative treatment before approving a referral. HMOs must have mechanisms to handle complaints which sometimes result in a delay of referral, or complaints about other patient care or coverage concerns.

Know This

In an HMO, a gatekeeper helps control the cost of healthcare by only making the necessary referrals.

#### Hospital Services and Emergency Care

The HMO provides the member with inpatient hospital care, in or out of the service area. The services may be limited for treatment of mental, emotional or nervous disorders, including alcohol or drug rehabilitation or treatment.

Emergency care must be provided for the member in or out of the HMO's service area. If emergency care is being provided for a member outside the service area, the HMO will make an effort to get the member back into the service area so that care can be provided by salaried member physicians.

#### Other Basic Services

HMOs have the _option_ of providing one or more of the following **supplemental benefits**:

- Long-term care;
    
- Nursing services;
    
- Home health care;
    
- Prescription drugs;
    
- Dental care;
    
- Vision care;
    
- Mental health care; or
    
- Substance abuse services.
    

### 3. Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Point of Service (POS) Plans

The Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) could be seen as the traditional medical system's answer to HMOs. In the PPO system, the physicians are paid **fees for their services** rather than a salary, but the member is encouraged to visit approved member physicians that have previously agreed upon the fees to be charged. This encouragement comes in the form of benefits. While the members can utilize any physician they choose, the PPO may provide 90% of the cost of a physician on their approved list while possibly only providing for 70% of the cost if the member chooses to utilize a physician not included on the PPO's approved list.

The **Point-Of-Service (POS)** plan is merely a combination of HMO and PPO plans.

#### General Characteristics

A **PPO** is a group of physicians and hospitals that contract with employers, insurers, or third-party organizations to provide medical care services at a reduced fee. The PPOs differ from the HMOs in two ways. First, they do not provide care on a prepaid basis, but physicians are paid a _fee for service_. Secondly, subscribers are not required to use physicians or facilities that have contracts with the PPO.

Know This

Unlike HMOs, PPOs allow more flexibility between in-network and out-network providers, in exchange for a higher premium.

In a **POS** plan, the doctors are usually paid on a capitation basis: they get a set fee per person regardless of the amount of service performed. Both PPO and POS plans offer a greater selection of providers compared to HMOs.

With the Point-Of-Service plan the employees do not have to be locked into one plan or make a choice between the two plans. A different choice can be made every time a need arises for medical services.

#### In-network and Out-of-network Provider Access

When a medical caregiver contracts with a health organization to provide services to its members or subscribers, but retains the right to treat patients who are not members or subscribers, it is referred to as **open panel.** In an open panel arrangement, the doctors are not considered to be employees of the health organization.

When the medical caregiver provides services to only members or subscribers of a health organization, and contractually is not allowed to treat other patients, it is referred to as **closed panel.** In a closed panel arrangement, the doctors are considered employees of the health organization.

**PPO plans**, like HMOs, enter into contractual arrangements with health care providers who form a provider network. However, plan members do not have to use only in-network providers for their care.

Similarly, in a **POS plan** the individuals can visit an in-network provider at their discretion. If they decide to use an out-of-network physician, they may do so. However, the member copays, coinsurance and deductibles may be substantially higher.

**In POS plans**, participants usually have access to a provider network that is controlled by a primary care physician ("gatekeeping"). Plan members, however, have an option to seek care outside the network, but at reduced coverage levels. POS plans are also referred to as "open-ended HMOs."

Any physician or hospital that qualifies and agrees to follow the PPO’s standards and charge the appropriate fees that the PPO has established can be added to the PPO’s approved list at any time. Physicians and providers may belong to several PPO groups simultaneously.

#### Primary Care Physician Referral

**In a PPO**, the insured does not have to select a primary care physician. The insured may choose medical providers not found on the preferred list and still retain coverage. The insured is allowed to receive care from any provider, but if the insured selects a PPO provider, the insured will pay lower out-of-pocket costs. If an out-of-network provider is used, the insured's out-of-pocket costs will be higher. In a PPO, all network providers are considered "preferred," and insureds can visit any of them, even specialists, without first seeing a primary care physician. Certain services may require plan pre-certification, an evaluation of the medical necessity of inpatient admissions and the number of days required to treat a physical condition.

Know This

In-network provider = lower out-of-pocket costs; out-of-network provider = higher out-of-pocket costs.

The Point-Of-Service (POS) plan combines "gatekeeping" arrangements with the ability to self-refer at increased out-of-pocket costs. A patient can obtain a higher level of benefits at a lower cost when care is provided by or arranged through the primary care physician (PCP). Benefits for covered services when self-referring (without having your primary care physician arrange for the service) are generally more expensive.

#### Catastrophic Coverage

Catastrophic health plans emphasize coverage for hospitalization or serious illness only. These feature a higher deductible and a lower monthly premium payment.

#### Indemnity Plan Features

If a non-member physician is utilized under the Point-Of-Service plan, then the attending physician will be paid a fee for service, but the member patient will have to pay a higher coinsurance amount or percentage for the privilege.

**Fixed indemnity** refers to health insurance policies that allow insureds to choose the doctor they would like to receive care from and the hospital that they would like to receive care in. In addition, fixed indemnity plans allow insureds to decide what kind of health care services they wish to have (within the limits of the policy provisions).

Most indemnity policies are offered as deductible health care plans. The insured may choose they deductible amount (the higher the deductible, the lower the premium rate). Most plans have copayment requirements that are determined by percentages applied after the deductible amount has been reached.

Hospital indemnity, long-term care, cancer policies and long-term disability coverage that are written as separate policies are also classified as fixed indemnity policies.

Stop-loss or excess health insurance policies are not classified as fixed indemnity policies.

### 4. Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs)

An **Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)** is a type of preferred provider organization in which individual members use particular preferred providers rather than having a choice of a variety of preferred providers. An EPO is characterized by a primary physician who monitors care and makes referrals to a network of providers.
