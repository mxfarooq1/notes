With the dramatic rise in the cost of medical care over the past few decades, the concept of **managed care** has become a necessity for insurance companies. Managed care plans, such as HMOs and PPOs, are designed to control costs by controlling the behavior of the plan participants.

### 1. Cost Saving Services

Cost-saving services or case-management provisions provide plans with controlled access of providers, large claim management, preventive care, hospitalization alternatives, second surgical opinions, preadmission testing, catastrophic case management, risk sharing, and providing high quality of care. Insurance companies use the services of case managers for large, ongoing claims through a process of utilization management. The case manager evaluates the appropriateness, necessity, and quality of health care, and may include prospective and concurrent review.

### 2. Utilization Review

Utilization management is a system for reviewing the appropriateness and efficient allocation of health care services and resources that are being given or are proposed to be given to an insured. It also covers the review of claims for services that may be covered by a health care provider. There are different types of utilization management reviews: prospective, retrospective, and concurrent review.

#### Prospective Review

Under the **prospective review** or **precertification process**, the physician can submit claim information prior to providing treatment to know in advance if the procedure is covered under the insured’s plan and at what rate it will be paid.

#### Concurrent Review

Under the **concurrent review** process, the insurance company will monitor the insured’s hospital stay to make sure that everything is proceeding according to schedule, and that the insured will be released from the hospital as planned.

#### Retrospective Review

Under the **retrospective review** process, employers and insurers can evaluate the utilization review process and the effectiveness of the professionals involved in large claims. These reviews include hospital bill audits.
