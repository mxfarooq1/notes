Basic medical expense insurance refers to various essential medical, hospital and surgical benefits. The early health insurance policies sold after the Great Depression were basic plans, which were offered separately as hospital, medical, and surgical plans. Basic plans were characterized by first-dollar coverage (no deductible) and low dollar limits, which meant they afforded no protection to an individual or family against catastrophic medical expenses that could be financially disastrous.

The broad category of medical expense coverages can provide a wide range of benefits, or policies may be narrowly written and provide only one or two types of coverage.

### 1. Fee-for-Service Basis vs. Prepaid Basis

Medical expense plans could be **fee-for-service** where providers receive a payment for their billed charges for each service provided. **Prepaid plans** provide medical and hospital benefits in the form of service rather than dollars. In prepaid plans the providers are compensated regularly whether or not they provide service, but no additional compensation is provided when services are rendered.

### 2. Specified Coverages vs. Comprehensive Care

**Specified coverage** policies are those insurance policies that limit coverage to one illness or one limiting group of coverages, e.g., cancer policies, prescription drug coverage, dental plans, and other limited coverage plans. These policies are commonly written as a stand-alone individual policy or to complement a traditional fee-for-service Major Medical Expense Policy.

**Comprehensive care** policies are those plans that provide coverage for most types of medical expenses: a comprehensive package of health care services that typically includes preventive care, routine physicals, immunizations, outpatient services and hospitalization, such as HMOs.

### 3. Benefit Schedule vs. Usual, Reasonable, Customary Charges

Some medical expense insurance plans contain a **benefit schedule**, which very specifically states exactly what is covered in the plan and for how much. Other plans may incorporate the term **usual/reasonable/customary**. _Usual/reasonable/customary_ means that the insurance company will pay an amount for a given procedure based upon the average charge for that procedure in that specific geographic area.

### 4. Any Provider vs. Limited Choice of Providers

More traditional, reimbursement-type comprehensive medical expense plans allow the insured to be treated by **any** qualified physician. The newer managed care plans limit their benefits to physicians and care centers that are on their **specific list** of providers.

### 5. Insureds vs. Subscribers

The participants in a plan are either considered insureds or subscribers. **Insureds** are people covered by insurance, and who usually receive health insurance benefits. **Subscribers** (also referred to as **participants or members**) are people who sign up for prepaid health plans, such as HMOs. In an individual policy, a subscriber is a person in whose name the contract is issued; in group policies, subscriber means a person whose employment or other status (with the exception of family dependency) is the basis for eligibility for the enrollments in an HMO.

Commercial insurance companies issuing fee-for-service contracts refer to the persons eligible for benefits under the policy as "insureds." Those organizations, such as Blue Cross, HMOs, and PPOs that offer prepaid plans use the term "subscribers" rather than "insureds." In effect, the terms "insured" and "subscriber" refer to the persons eligible for coverage under the plan.

Most commercial health insurance companies refer to their policyholders as insureds. But when Blue Cross organizations formed, they developed prepaid plans with hospitals for their members which they chose to call subscribers rather than insureds largely because of the pre-paid mechanism. To this day, Blue Cross/Blue Shield groups refer to their members as subscribers.
