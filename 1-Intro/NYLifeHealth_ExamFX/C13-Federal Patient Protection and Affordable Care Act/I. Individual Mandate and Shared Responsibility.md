Originally, the Affordable Care Act required all U.S. citizens and legal residents to have qualifying health care coverage. This was known as the **individual mandate**, and was part of the Act's **Shared Responsibility Provision**. If the individual did not have qualifying health care, a federal tax penalty would be assessed, based on the individual's taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status.

As of 2019, the individual mandate and shared responsibility penalty **no longer apply**. However, many states have their own individual health insurance mandate. In these states, an individual must have qualifying health coverage or pay a **state tax penalty**.

**Employer Penalties:** The following are penalties for employers with more than 50 full-time employees if at least one employee receives a premium tax credit for health care coverage:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Coverage**|**Penalty Tax**|
|Employer **does not** offer coverage|$2,000 per full-time employee  <br>(first 30 employees are excluded)|
|Employer **offers** coverage|The lesser of $3,000 per employee who receives a premium tax credit or $2,000 per each full-time employee  (first 30 employees are excluded)|

Employers who have fewer than 50 full-time employees are exempt from these penalties.
