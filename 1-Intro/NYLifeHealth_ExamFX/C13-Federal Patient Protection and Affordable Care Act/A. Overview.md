The **Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act** (PPACA), or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), for short, was signed into law on March 23, 2010, as part of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, to be implemented in phases until fully effective in 2018. Since the bill is a federal law, state regulations are superseded by the PPACA and must conform accordingly.

The Affordable Care Act has mandated increased preventive, educational, and community-based health care services, and was designed to do the following:

- Set up a new competitive private health insurance market;
- Hold insurance companies accountable by keeping premiums low, preventing denials of care and allowing applicants with pre-existing conditions to obtain coverage (pre-existing conditions exclusions have been eliminated as of January 2014);
- Help stabilize budget and economy through reducing the deficit by cutting government overspending; and
- Extend coverage for adult children in both individual and group health plans until age 26.

In addition, it gives small businesses and nonprofits a tax credit for an employer's contribution to health insurance for employees. It prohibits insurance companies from rescinding health coverage when an insured becomes ill, and eliminates lifetime benefit limits.

Specific health coverage plans, such as retiree-only, stand-alone dental plans, Medigap, and long-term care insurance are generally **exempt** from the PPACA changes.

Because these provisions are controversial and health care laws are being challenged in the courts, agents should review current laws to be certain they are giving up-to-date advice.

**Eligibility:** The Health Insurance Marketplace makes health coverage available to any uninsured individuals. To be eligible for health coverage through the Marketplace, the individual

- Must be a U.S. citizen or national or be lawfully present in the United States;
- Must live in the United States; and
- Cannot be currently incarcerated.

If an individual has Medicare coverage, that individual is **not eligible** to use the Marketplace to buy a health or dental plan.

**Health status (no discrimination):** A group health plan or a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish rules for eligibility based on any of the following health status-related factors related to individuals or their dependents:

- Health status;
- Medical condition (including both physical and mental illnesses);
- Claims experience;
- Receipt of health care;
- Medical history;
- Genetic information;
- Evidence of insurability (including conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence);
- Disability; or
- Any other health status related factor.

When health insurers set their **premium rates**, they are only permitted to base those rates on 4 standards:

1. Geographic rating area (location of residence within the state);
2. Family composition (single or family enrollment);
3. Age; and
4. Tobacco use.

For individual plans, the location is the insured's home address; for small group plans, the location is the employer's principal place of business.

**Essential benefits:** Essential benefits include hospitalization, maternity, emergency services, wellness and preventive services, and chronic disease management.

- Note that all Health Insurance Marketplace plans must cover pregnancy and childbirth, even if pregnancy begins before the coverage takes effect.

**Guaranteed issue:** Insurance companies must accept any eligible applicant for individual or group insurance coverage. Enrollment for coverage may be restricted to open or special enrollment periods.

**Guaranteed renewability:** An insurance company that offers either group or individual health insurance coverage must renew or continue the policy at the option of the plan sponsor or the individual.

**Pre-existing conditions:** The law creates a new program, the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, to make health coverage available to individuals who have been denied health insurance by private insurance companies because of a pre-existing condition.

**Appeal rights:** If an insurer _rescinds_ individual or group coverage for reasons of fraud or an intentional misrepresentation of material facts by the insured, the insurer must provide at least **30 days' advance notice** to allow the insured time to appeal. An enrollee or insured has the right to review their file, to present evidence and testimony as part of the appeal process, and to keep their coverage in force pending the outcomes of the appeals process.

**Coverage for children of the insured:** The law extends coverage for children of the insured to age 26 regardless of their marital status, residency, financial dependence on their parents, or eligibility to enroll in their employer's plan. Coverage for dependent children may continue beyond the limiting age (the child's 26th birthday) if the child continues to be:

- Incapable of self-sustaining employment because of an intellectual or physical disability; and
- Chiefly dependent upon the policyholder or subscriber for support and maintenance.

**Lifetime and annual limits:** Health plans are restricted from applying a dollar limit on essential benefits, nor can they establish a dollar limit on the amount of benefits paid during the course of an insured's lifetime.

**Emergency care:** Emergency services must be covered, even at an out-of-network provider, for amounts that would have been paid to an in-network provider for the same services.

**Preventive benefits:** The ACA requires that 100% of preventive care be covered **without cost sharing**. Preventive care includes routine checkups, screenings, and counseling to prevent health problems.

**Cost-sharing under Group Health Plans:** A group health plan must ensure that any annual cost-sharing imposed does not exceed provided limitations.

The ACA has established **insurance exchanges** that will administer health insurance subsidies and facilitate enrollment in private health insurance, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). An exchange can help the applicant to do the following:

- Compare private health plans;
- Obtain information about health coverage options to make educated decisions;
- Obtain information about eligibility or tax credits for most affordable coverage; and
- Enroll in a health plan that meets the applicant's needs.
