Employers must provide at least a minimum value (MV) plan that covers 60% or more of the participant's expected health care costs. To determine if an employer's plan meets the requirement, an employer can use one of three methods: the MV Calculator, a Safe Harbor Checklist, or an Actuarial Certification.

- The **MV Calculator** uses standard population data along with the employer plan cost-sharing and benefits to determine whether a plan meets the requirements.
- The **Safe Harbor checklist** uses a standard population database along with data from a self-insured plan. If the plan's cost-sharing and benefits meet the 60% requirement or are more generous, the plan meets the MV.
- With the **Actuarial Certification** method, employers hire an actuary who uses the plan's cost-sharing and benefit coverages along with standard population data to determine if the plan meets the MV.
