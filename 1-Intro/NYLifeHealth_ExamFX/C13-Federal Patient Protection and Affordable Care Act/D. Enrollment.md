State insurance exchanges must provide for an **initial open enrollment period**, **annual open enrollment** periods after the initial period (currently scheduled from November 1 through January 31), and **special enrollment** periods. Unless specifically stated otherwise, individuals or enrollees have 60 days from the date of a triggering event to select a qualified health plan. Triggering, or qualifying, events include marriage, divorce, birth or adoption of a child, change in employment, or termination of health coverage.

Qualified individuals and enrollees may enroll in or change from one qualified health plan to another as a result of the following triggering events:

- A qualified individual or dependent loses minimum essential coverage;
- A qualified individual gains a dependent or becomes a dependent through marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption;
- An individual who was not previously a citizen or lawfully present individual who gains such status;
- A qualified individual's enrollment or non-enrollment in a qualified health plan is unintentional or erroneous and is the result of the error, misrepresentation, or inaction of an officer, employee, or agent of the exchange;
- An enrollee adequately demonstrates that the qualified health plan in which they are enrolled substantially violated a material provision of its contract;
- An individual is determined newly eligible or newly ineligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit or has a change in eligibility for cost-sharing reductions, regardless of whether such individual is already enrolled in a qualified health plan;
- A qualified individual or enrollee gains access to new qualified health plans as a result of a permanent move;
- A Native American, as defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, may enroll in a qualified health plan or change from one qualified health plan to another one time per month; and
- A qualified individual or enrollee demonstrates that they meet other exceptional circumstances as the exchange may provide.
