Under PPACA, plans are classified into 5 categories of coverage in the Marketplace: four "metal level" plans and catastrophic plans.

The **metal levels** plans pay different amounts of the total costs of an average person's care. The actual percentage the insured will pay in total or per service will depend on the services used during the year. On average, the metal level plans will pay as follows:

1. Bronze: 60%
2. Silver: 70%
3. Gold: 80%
4. Platinum: 90%

Under the bronze plan, for example, the health plan is expected to cover 60% of the cost for an average population, and the participants would cover the remaining 40%. Participants with severe disease may pay significantly more.

All insurers that offer adult and family coverage under the metal levels must also offer child-only coverage.

Young adults under age 30, and individuals who cannot obtain affordable coverage (have a hardship exemption) may be able to purchase individual **catastrophic plans** that cover essential benefits. These plans offer lower monthly premiums but also feature high deductibles (several thousand dollars). The insured is usually required to pay all medical costs up to a certain amount. After the insured reaches the deductible, costs for essential health benefits will be covered by the catastrophic plan with no copayment or coinsurance.

Under the ACA, premium discounts may be awarded to low-income individuals, regardless of the chosen metal levels.

### 1. Benchmark Plans

A **benchmark plan** is the second-lowest priced silver plan available within a state health insurance exchange in a geographical region. Benchmark plans determine the specifics of the Essential Health Benefits required of every Affordable Care Act plan sold in the state. Tax credit amounts are derived on the cost of this benchmark plan and are then adjusted according to an enrollee's annual income. Consumers who are eligible for premium tax credits are not required to purchase the benchmark plan in their region and will not lose out on these credits by choosing a different plan.
