Enrollment in the Health Insurance Market place began in October 2013, and tax credits for those who qualify became available in 2014.

After submitting an application for health insurance for a qualified health plan, **individuals** will be able to take an advance tax credit to reduce the cost of their health care coverage if purchased through an exchange. For the purposes of the premium tax credit, household income is defined as the Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) of the taxpayer, spouse, and dependents. The MAGI calculation includes income sources such as wages, salary, foreign income, interest, dividends, and Social Security.

Legal residents and citizens who have incomes **between 100% and 400%** of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) are eligible for the tax credits. States have the option of extending Medicaid coverage to people under 138% of the FPL. Persons who receive public coverage like Medicare or Medicaid are not eligible for the tax credits.

Persons who are eligible for a premium tax credit and have household **incomes between 100% and 250% of FPL** are eligible for cost-sharing subsidies (reductions). Eligible individuals will be required to purchase a silver level plan in order to receive the cost-sharing subsidy.

The tax credit is sent directly to the insurance company, and reduces the insured's monthly health care premiums. Tax credits are based upon the individual's or family's expected annual income.

**Small employers** that offer health plans may be eligible for federal tax credits, depending on the average wages and size of the employer. These tax credits, available to low-wage employers (under $50,000 average per employee) with 25 or fewer workers, may cover up to 50% of premiums paid for small business employers and 35% of premiums paid for small tax-exempt employers.

To be eligible for the credit, a small employer must pay premiums on behalf of employees enrolled in a qualified health plan offered through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP).

The credit is available to eligible employers for 2 consecutive taxable years.

### 1. APTC

**Advance payments of the premium tax credit**, or **APTC,** is a tax credit that can help individuals afford coverage bought through the Marketplace. These tax credits can be used right away to lower the monthly premium costs for insurance. If the insured qualifies, the insured may choose how much advance credit payments to apply the premiums each month, up to a maximum amount. If the amount of advance credit payments for the year is less than the tax credit due, the insured will get the difference as a refundable credit when the insured files the federal income tax return. If the advance payments for the year are more than the amount of the credit, the insured must repay the excess advance payments with the tax return.

APTC is paid on a sliding scale, from 100% of FPL to 400% of FPL. It is generally calculated based on attested projected annual income for the upcoming coverage year. Maximum APTC is calculated with reference to income and applicable second lowest cost silver plan.
