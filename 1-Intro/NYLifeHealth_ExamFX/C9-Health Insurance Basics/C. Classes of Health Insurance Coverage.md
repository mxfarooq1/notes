**Health insurance** is a generic term encompassing several types of insurance contracts which, though related, are designed to protect against different risks.

There are two separate types of insurance included in the generic term _health insurance_. One type provides coverage for expenses related to health care, and the second is designed to provide payments for loss of income. The terminology used to reference health insurance varies from state to state as well as from company to company. The health insurance policy that is designed to provide periodic payments when an insured is unable to work because of sickness or injury is referred to as **disability income insurance**.

### 1. Individual and Group

Most health insurance is written on a group basis from one’s employer. Individual coverage may be available for a family, but it would be medically underwritten.

**Individual health insurance policies** are underwritten to cover the applicant, their spouse and family. Many of the factors considered in life insurance underwriting apply. However, unlike life insurance where there can be only one death claim per insured, in health insurance, multiple claims per insured is the rule rather than the exception. For this reason, underwriting and classification of risk is extremely important from an insurance company standpoint.

The three most important underwriting factors considered in accepting or classifying health insurance applicants are as follows:

1. Physical condition of the applicant and other insureds;
2. Moral and morale hazards; and
3. Occupation.

From a consumer's standpoint, the right to continue the policy is extremely important, particularly if the consumer has become uninsurable. While nearly all states have adopted the NAIC model law for uniform mandatory provisions, there are still more variables in individual health insurance policies than other types of policies.

**Group health insurance** underwriting varies in important particulars from that of individual health insurance. While the purpose remains the same, evaluation of the inherent hazard and assignment of the appropriate class and premium rate, the techniques and standards for evaluation are decidedly different.

The group underwriter has the responsibility not only of deciding whether and on what basis the group may be insured, but also of drawing the contract in such a way as to prevent adverse selection against the insurer by individuals eligible for coverage. Few applications for group health insurance are rejected if the applicant complies with any applicable statutory definition of a group eligible for this type of coverage. In part, this is because the underwriter may adjust the coverage and requirements necessary to afford protection to the insured. The underwriter's attitude toward group risks can be less restrictive than with individual policies, because the group policies are subject to annual re-evaluation on the anniversary date. Remedial measures may be taken if the initial evaluation proved to be incorrect.

### 2. Private vs. Government

Private insurance companies provide a large portion of all individual and group health insurance. The federal government, however, provides coverage for some disabled individuals and those over age 65 in the form of Medicare and Medicaid. Medicaid offers assistance as both a federal- and state-sponsored program. The federal government also offers disability insurance protection through the Social Security system.

### 3. Limited vs. Comprehensive

**Limited** health insurance policies only cover specific accidents or diseases. A **comprehensive** plan would cover all sickness or accidents that are not specifically excluded.
