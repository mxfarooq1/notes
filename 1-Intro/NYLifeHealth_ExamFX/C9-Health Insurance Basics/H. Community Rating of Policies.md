**Community rating** is a rating methodology in which the premium for all persons covered by a policy or contract form is the same, **based on the experience of the entire pool of risks** covered by that policy or contract regardless to age, sex, health status or occupation.

All individual and small group health policies issued in New York must be community rated and underwritten to involve no more than pre-existing condition limitation. Any individual or group member and their dependents applying for health coverage must be accepted at all times, throughout the year, for any hospital and/or medical coverage offered by the corporation to such individuals or small groups in this state. Once accepted for coverage, an individual or small group cannot be terminated by the insurer due to claims experience.

Premium rate structures may still be used to establish different premium rates for individuals as opposed to family units or separate community rates for individuals as opposed to small groups.

Insurers may use separate community rates for reasonable geographic regions which may include a single county. These regions must be approved by the Superintendent, who will not require the inclusion of any specific geographic regions as long as the proposed regions do not contain any configurations designed to avoid or segregate particular areas within a county.
