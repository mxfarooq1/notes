### 1. Loss of Income From Disability

Loss of income caused by accident and/or sickness that results in the insured's inability to work and earn income is covered under disability income policies or coverages. Disability income insurance is a valued contract or stated amount that pays weekly or monthly benefits due to an injury or sickness. Benefits may be determined by the insured's past earnings and may be limited to a percentage of that income.

### 2. Hospital and Medical Expense

A medical expense contract covers many of the expenses one incurs from an accident or sickness, such as a physician or hospital expense. Expenses may be paid directly to the insured, and the insured would be responsible for paying the medical expenses. This type of benefit payment is called **reimbursement**. If expenses are paid on a scheduled basis, the insurance company will refer to a list determining the cost of the treatment, and it will only pay up to a certain amount. If a person were covered as a dependent under their spouse’s group insurance, payment of medical expenses would be coordinated.

Know This

Medical expense benefits are considered reimbursement benefits.

### 3. Long-Term Care Expenses

Long-term care policies provide benefits for medically necessary services that an insured receives in a nursing home or their own home (home health care), but not care received in an acute care unit of a hospital.
