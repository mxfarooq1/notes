This section will present different classes of health insurance policies, as well as concepts that generally apply to health insurance. You will begin by learning about the principal types of losses and benefits, common exclusions from coverage, and producer’s responsibilities and liabilities for errors. This section will take an in-depth look at health insurance underwriting. This type of underwriting is particularly prone to unfair discrimination because of the presence of certain health conditions and the use of genetic information. Finally, you will learn about the concept of policy replacement and factors to consider in determining the best course of action.
