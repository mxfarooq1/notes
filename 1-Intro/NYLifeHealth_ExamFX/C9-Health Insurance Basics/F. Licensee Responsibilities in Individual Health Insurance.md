### 1. Marketing Requirements

#### Advertising

The purpose of rules and regulations regarding **advertisements** is to ensure truthful and adequate disclosure of relevant information to the consumer, and to prevent unfair competition among insurers.

Advertising rules apply to any accident and sickness insurance advertisement intended for presentation, distribution, dissemination or other advertising use when used or made either directly or indirectly by or on behalf of the insurance company. The term _advertisements_ includes any printed or published material, descriptive literature and sales aids, prepared sales talks and presentations, and material included with a policy.

Every insurance company must establish and at all times maintain a system of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of all advertising of its policies. The insurer whose policies are advertised is responsible for all these advertisements, regardless of who wrote, created, presented, or distributed the advertisements.

#### Sales Presentations

Sales presentations must be **accurate and complete**. Sales materials include any and all promotional materials, policy applications, replacement forms, outline of coverage and any other forms or information used in connection with solicitation or sale of accident and health insurance.

#### Outline of Coverage

An **outline of coverage** must be delivered at the time of application or upon delivery of the policy. With direct response sales, however, the insurer does not have an opportunity to provide the outline of coverage at the time of application, so it is not required. The purpose of the outline of coverage provision is to provide full and fair disclosure to the applicant.

In the state of New York, Outline of Coverage is referred to as a **Disclosure Form**, which basically summarizes the policy's coverage and exclusions.

### 2. Application Procedures

An application for insurance begins with a form provided by the company and completed by the agent as questions are asked of the applicant, and the applicant’s responses are recorded. This form – often called the “app” – is then submitted to the insurance company for its approval or rejection. The application is the applicant’s written request to the insurance company to issue a policy or contract based upon the information contained in the application. If the policy is issued, a copy of this application is stapled in the back of the policy and it becomes part of the **entire contract.**

The agent must take special care with the accuracy of the application in the interest of both the company and the insured. Because the application is often the main source of underwriting information, it is the agent's responsibility to make certain that the application is filled out completely, correctly, and to the best of the applicant's knowledge.

It is the agent's responsibility to make sure that an application for insurance is complete and accurate to the best knowledge of the applicant.

Every health insurance application requires the signature of the proposed insured, the policyowner (if different than the insured), and the agent who solicits the insurance.

Because the application is so important, most companies require that it be filled out in ink. The agent might make a mistake when filling out the app or the applicant might answer a question incorrectly and want to change it. There are two ways to correct an application. The first and best is to simply start over with a fresh application. If that is not practical, draw a line through the incorrect answer and insert the correct one. **The applicant must initial the correct answer.**

Know This

Any changes on the application must be initialed by the applicant or insured.

Under the terms of the insurability conditional receipt, the insurance coverage becomes effective as of the date of the receipt, provided the application is approved. This receipt is generally provided to the applicant when the initial premium is paid at the time of application.

### 3. Requirements at Delivery of Policy

Although policy delivery may be accomplished without physically delivering it in the policyowner's possession, an agent should personally deliver policies whenever possible. Once the delivery of a policy is made, the free-look period begins.

When delivering the policy, the agent should review the insured’s original goals and needs. The policy should also be thoroughly reviewed with the insured.

In many cases, the initial premium is not paid until the policy is delivered. Most insurance companies require that when collecting the premium, the agent must also obtain a statement signed by the insured testifying to continued good health.
