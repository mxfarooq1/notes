### 1. Limited Benefits and Amounts

There are a variety of health insurance policies providing limited coverage for specific accidents or sickness. These contracts must specify the type of accident or sickness covered, limited perils and amounts of coverage. Benefits may be paid on an **expense-paid** (reimbursement) basis or **indemnity** basis.

Know This

Limited policies cover a specific sickness or accident only.

### 2. Required Notice to Insured

To make sure that the insured is aware that the policy’s benefits are limited, the insurance company must, by law, plainly state the **limited policy notice** on the first page of the policy, “THIS IS A LIMITED POLICY.”

### 3. Types of Limited Policies

#### Accident-only

**Accident-only** policies are limited policies that provide coverage for death, dismemberment, disability or hospital and medical care resulting from an accident. Because it is a limited medical expense policy, it will _only pay_ _for losses resulting from accidents_ and not sickness.

#### Specified (Dread) Disease

A **dread disease**, or limited risk, policy provides a variety of benefits for a specific disease such as cancer policy or heart disease policy. Benefits are usually paid as a _scheduled, fixed-dollar amount_ of indemnity for specified events or medical procedures, such as hospital confinement or chemotherapy.

#### Hospital Indemnity (Income)

A **hospital indemnity** policy provides a specific amount on a daily, weekly or monthly basis while the insured is confined to a hospital. Payment under this type of policy is unrelated to the medical expense incurred, but _based only on the number of days confined in a hospital._ This can also be called a hospital fixed-rate policy.

#### Dental

Usually dental insurance distinguishes among several classes of dental expenses, and provides somewhat different treatment for each.

**Routine and preventive maintenance** is covered up to an annual maximum without a deductible or copayment. This coverage benefit usually includes routine examinations and teeth cleaning once a year, and perhaps full-mouth X-ray once every 3 years. The absence of a deductible and copayment is intended to encourage preventive maintenance.

**Routine and major restorative care** includes treatments for cavities, oral surgery, bridges and dentures. These procedures are covered up to a specific maximum, subject to an annual deductible per insured family member and coinsurance.

**Orthodontic care**, if included, will have a separate maximum and a separate deductible, which may differ from the deductible for restorative care.

#### Vision Care

Some employers provide this form of group health insurance to their employees to cover eye examinations and eyeglasses, or hearing aids on a limited basis. Know that per the Affordable Care Act, pediatric vision benefits are mandatory.

It is common in most vision expense insurance plans to restrict benefits to **one exam** and **one pair of glasses** in any 12-month period.
