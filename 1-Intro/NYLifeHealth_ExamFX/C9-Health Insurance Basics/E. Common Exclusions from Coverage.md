The following losses are typically **not covered** in individual or group medical expense policies:

- **War or act of war** injuries or sicknesses; active military duty may be also excluded from coverage;
- **Intentionally self-inflicted injuries**;
- **Elective cosmetic surgery**; however, if treatment is required to correct a condition due to an accident or a birth defect, or is medically necessary, then coverage may be available;
- **Experimental/investigation procedures**;
- **Conditions covered by workers compensation** if they are covered under workers compensation laws or other legislation;
- **Government plans:** health insurance policies exclude expenses either paid or eligible for payment under Medicare or other federal, state, or local medical expense program;
- **Participation in criminal activity:** if a person is injured while committing an illegal act, health insurance will not cover the expense of the injury;
- **Injuries resulting from drug or alcohol intoxication** (unless administered by a physician).
