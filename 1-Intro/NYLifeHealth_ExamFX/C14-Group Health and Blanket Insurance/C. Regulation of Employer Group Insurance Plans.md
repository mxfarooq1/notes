### 1. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)

The **Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)** is a federal law that was enacted to ensure that employees receive the pension and other benefits promised by their employers. ERISA also incorporates and is tied to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) designed to encourage employers to provide retirement benefits and other benefits to their employees. Many provisions of ERISA and the IRC are intended to ensure that tax-favored pension plans do not favor the highest-paid employees over rank-and-file employees in the way benefits are provided. To achieve these ends, ERISA has a complex series of rules that cover pension, profit-sharing stock bonus, and most "welfare benefit plans," such as health and life insurance. ERISA supersedes almost all state laws that affect employee benefit plans and has thus created a single federal standard for employee benefits.

#### Applicability

All forms of health care, life insurance, prepaid legal services, and disability insurance (both long-term and short-term) are considered **employee welfare benefit** plans. Unfunded benefits or payroll practices, such as vacation, holidays, overtime premiums, holiday gifts, and compensation paid for time not worked are not included. Group-type voluntary insurance programs to which the employer makes no contribution are also excluded.

ERISA treats as pension plans any form of deferred compensation such as deferred profit-sharing, stock purchasing, or savings and thrift plans, as well as pension plans.

Cash bonus plans, cash profit-sharing plans, and severance pay of less than 2 years are considered compensation and are not regulated by ERISA. A bonus plan, payment of which is systematically deferred and paid out over several years, is considered a pension plan.

#### Fiduciary Responsibilities

An employer's responsibilities under ERISA vary, depending on the type of plan involved. Pension plans, for example, are subject to all rules, including reporting and disclosure, financial management of benefit plan assets, administration of benefit plans, and participation, vesting, and funding requirements. Welfare plans (such as health insurance) need only worry about reporting and disclosure rules and financial management and plan administration standards.

#### Reporting and Disclosure

Different parts of ERISA are administered by different federal agencies. In general, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) administers the taxation of contributions and benefits. In the retirement-plan area, IRS is responsible for enforcing funding, participation, and vesting standards. The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation is in charge of pension insurance provisions. And the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) administers reporting and disclosure and the fiduciary requirements of ERISA that regulate the management of plan assets.

There are reporting and disclosure exemptions for small unfunded welfare plans. Governmental and church plans, plans established solely to comply with unemployment compensation laws, workers compensation law, disability insurance laws, and plans that are designed to provide benefits in excess of the deduction limits to certain employees are exempt from ERISA requirements. Unfunded plans maintained "primarily" to provide deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees are exempt from the participation and vesting, funding, and fiduciary responsibility requirements of the law. These plans are commonly referred to as "top hat" plans. They are generally subject (unless some other exemption or partial exemption applies) to the reporting and disclosure, and administration and enforcement provisions of ERISA.

### 2. Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)

Under the **Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA)**, an eligible employee is entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following reasons:

- The birth of a child of the employee in order to care for that child;
- The placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care;
- The care for the employee's spouse, a child, or parent who has a serious health condition;
- Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the duties of their occupation.

Except if the employee takes leave on an intermittent or reduced-leave schedule, any eligible employee who takes leave under FMLA is entitled upon return from leave to be restored to:

- The position of employment held when the leave began; or
- An equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.

According to the law, taking leave under FMLA cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit, such as group medical expense insurance, earned prior to the date on which the leave began.

### 3. Relationship with Medicare

#### Medicare Secondary Rules

When a person insured under an employer's group health coverage also qualifies for Medicare, it is important to determine which coverage is primary (pays first), and which coverage is secondary (pays second).

#### Medicare Carve-outs and Supplements

Medicare carve-out and supplement plans are available to individuals enrolled in Medicare, and act as excess insurance that pays for covered expenses not paid by Medicare, such as deductibles or copayments.

### 4. Nondiscrimination Rules (Highly Compensated)

To avoid nondiscrimination rules violations, and determine the number of employees in the top-paid group (highly-compensated employees), the following employees must be **excluded** from coverage:

- Have not completed 6 months of service;
    
- Normally work fewer than 17½ hours per week;
    
- Normally work during no more than 6 months per year;
    
- Are under the age of 21; and
    
- Included in a unit of employees covered by an agreement which the Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and the employer, except to the extent provided in regulations.
    

**Highly compensated employee** means any employee who:

- Owned more than 5% of the interest in the business at any time during the year or the preceding year (regardless of the employee's compensation); or
- For the preceding year, received compensation from the business in excess of specified dollar amount ($160,000 if the preceding year is 2025), and, if the employer so chooses, was in the top 20% of employees when ranked by compensation.
