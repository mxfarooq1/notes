The majority of all health insurance in force today is provided on a group basis. The cost of group health insurance is lower than the cost for individual coverage since the administrative costs and selling expenses found in group health insurance are far less.

Know This

Group health plans typically cost less than individual plans.

Since the current law in New York forbids health insurance companies from rejecting applicants because of health reasons, typically no medical underwriting takes place. Health underwriters generally look at such things as the employer's financial standing and credit rating.

### 1. Insurer Underwriting Criteria

Generally underwriting for group health insurance is similar to underwriting for individual health insurance coverage, but the underwriter evaluates the group as a whole rather than each individual member. The group’s risk profile determines whether the group will be accepted or rejected. As with any type of underwriting, the underwriter tries to avoid adverse selection. _Adverse selection_ describes the tendency of poorer risks seeking out insurance protection.

Group underwriting criteria help insurers determine the acceptability and premium to be charged, and to minimize the possibility of adverse selection. The following are considered in group health insurance underwriting:

- Certificates are guaranteed issue with no individual underwriting;
- Premiums are determined by age, sex, and occupation of the entire group;
- The reasons for forming the group are other than purchasing insurance;
- A certain participation level must be maintained;
- There is a flow of new members through the group; and
- There is an automatic determination of benefits which is not discriminatory (everyone has the same coverage).

#### Characteristics of Group

One of the differences between group underwriting and individual underwriting is that in groups of 50 or more, medical information cannot be required of plan participants. In small groups even one bad risk can have an impact on the claims experience of the group. That’s why in some states, insurers may allow some individual underwriting in small groups they insure.

#### Plan Design Factors

The same as group life insurance, group health insurance may be either contributory or noncontributory. With a **contributory** plan the eligible employees _contribute_ to payment of the premium (both the employee and employer pay part of the premium). In the state of New York, if a plan is contributory, at least 50% of all eligible employees must participate in the plan. If the plan is **noncontributory,** 100% of the eligible employees must be included, and the participants do not pay part of the premium. The employer pays the entire premium. The reason for these participation requirements is to guard the insurer against adverse selection and to reduce administrative costs.

#### Persistency Factors

**Persistency rate** for a group of policies means the ratio of the number of policies that continue coverage on a premium due date to the number of policies that were in force as of the preceding due date. The persistency rate usually improves with policy duration. In health insurance, persistency is important for the following main reasons:

- Expenses are higher during the first year than in subsequent years because of the costs of issuing the policy and certificates of insurance, and higher first-year commissions; and
- Claim rates usually increase as the age of the insured increases.

The underwriter takes persistency into consideration because groups that change insurance companies every year do not represent a good risk.

#### Administrative Capability

The per-capita administrative cost in group health insurance is less than the administrative cost found in individual coverage.

### 2. Eligibility For Coverage

Group health plans commonly impose a set of eligibility requirements that must be met before an individual member is eligible to participate in the group plan. It is common that in order to be eligible, the employee must be full time (usually 30 hours per week), and have been employed by the employer from 1 to 3 months.

#### Annual Open Enrollment

A **30-day open-enrollment period** is available once a year to employees who reject coverage during the initial enrollment period and later wish to have coverage or to add dependent coverage. Evidence of insurability is not required during the open-enrollment period.

Know This

Evidence of insurability is NOT required during the annual open enrollment period in group policies.

#### Employee Eligibility

Employer group health insurance generally requires that to be eligible for coverage an employee must be a full-time employee, working in a covered classification, and must be actively at work.

Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), employers must extend coverage to all employees who work more than 30 hours per week. In addition, small and large employers may not be denied coverage for failure to satisfy the minimum participation or contribution requirements.

#### Dependent Eligibility

Employer group health insurance generally requires a dependent of an employee to be

- A spouse;
    
- A child younger than the limiting age, including natural children of the insured, stepchildren, children legally placed for adoption, and legally adopted children; and/or
    
- Disabled children who are incapable of self-support because of a physical or mental disability, and are dependent upon the insured for support and maintenance.

Most insurers cover domestic or same-sex partners whether or not a state has a domestic partner or civil union law.

### 3. Coordination of Benefits Provisions

A **claim determination period** is the period of time, which must not be less than 12 consecutive months, over which allowable expenses are compared with total benefits payable in the absence of COB, to determine whether overinsurance exists, and how much each plan will pay or provide.

If the amount of the payment made by an insurer is more than it should have paid under its coordination of benefits provision, the insurer may recover the excess from any or all of the following:

- The person to whom the benefit has been paid;
- Insurance companies; or
- Other organizations.

A secondary plan that provides benefits in the form of services may recover the reasonable cash value of providing the services from the primary plan. The regulation must not be interpreted to require a plan to reimburse a covered person in cash for the value of services provided by the plan.

### 4. Change of Insurers or Loss of Coverage

Employees actively at work on the date the coverage is transferred to another insurance carrier are automatically covered under the new plan, and they are exempt from any probationary period. Employees not actively at work on the date the coverage is transferred must be included in the new plan, but their benefits can be limited to the prior plan’s level until they return to work.

#### Events that Terminate Coverage

Group insurance policies provide for a termination of benefits in the event of certain occurrences.

Generally, coverage will terminate **for an employee** on the earliest date in which one of the following occurs:

- Employment terminates;
    
- The employee ceases to be eligible;
    
- The date the overall maximum benefit for major medical benefits is received;
    
- The end of the last period for which the employee has made the required premium payments comes about; or
    
- The master contract is terminated.
    

Coverage will terminate **for a dependent** on the earliest date in which one of the following situations occurs:

- The dependent fails to meet the definition of a dependent;
    
- The overall maximum benefit for major medical benefits is received; or
    
- The end of the last period for which the employee has made the required premium for dependent coverage passes.
    

#### Extension of Benefits

When a group policy is discontinued, the policy must provide for a reasonable **extension of benefits** to any covered person who is totally disabled at the time the group policy is terminated.

#### Continuation of Coverage under COBRA and New York Continuation

There have been a number of state and federal statutes passed in recent years to protect insureds when their employment is terminated.

New York law mandates that all employers with health plans must offer a 6-month continuation of the current health plan to terminated employees and their dependents. The employee must elect the continuation privilege within 30 days and is responsible for the full premium payment for the coverage. After the 6-month period, a conversion privilege must be offered to the employee. The conversion plan does not have to be as comprehensive as the group plan.

The **Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985** (**COBRA**) requires any employer with 20 or more employees to extend group health coverage to terminated employees and their families after a qualifying event related either to personal or professional changes.

**Qualifying events** include the following:

- Voluntary termination of employment;
- Termination of employment for reasons other than gross misconduct (e.g., company downsizing); and
- Employment status change: from full time to part time.

For any of these qualifying events, coverage may be extended for up to **18 months**. For other qualifying events, such as **death** of the employee, **divorce**, or **legal separation**, the coverage period for the dependents may be extended up to **36 months**. The terminated employee must exercise extension of benefits under COBRA within **60 days** of separation from employment. The employer is permitted to collect a premium from the terminated employee at a rate of no more than 102% of the individual’s group premium rate. The 2% charge is to cover the employer’s administrative costs.

It is important to remember that COBRA benefits apply to group health insurance, not group life insurance. In addition, unlike the conversion privilege in which the individual converts coverage to an individual health insurance policy, COBRA continues the same group coverage the employee had and the employee pays the group premium that the employer paid (or employer and employee paid if the plan was contributory).

Note that under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, coverage for children of the insured must extend until the adult child reaches the **age of 26** (unless the child qualifies as a disabled dependent). The same age limit applies to COBRA coverage for eligible children of the insured. In addition, in the event of loss of dependent child status under the group plan, the dependent child qualifies for a maximum period of continuation coverage of **36 months.**

There are also several **disqualifying events** under which the COBRA benefits may be discontinued. These include failure to make a premium payment, becoming covered under another group plan, becoming eligible for Medicare, or if the employer terminates all group health plans.

Know This

Coverage for dependents under COBRA may be extended to 36 months in the event of the employee's divorce or death.

#### Conversion Privilege

Any group policy providing hospital or surgical expense insurance (but not including insurance against specific diseases or accidental injury only) must provide a **conversion privilege** for employees in the event that insurance ends because the policy has been terminated or the insured is no longer employed or in the class eligible for coverage.

An insured employee will then be entitled to convert to an individual policy within **60 days** without evidence of insurability. The insurer has the option of providing coverage under a group insurance policy rather than issuing a converted individual policy.

An insurer is not required to issue a converted policy if the person is already covered for similar benefits through another policy or contract, and the issuance of a converted policy would result in overinsurance or duplication of benefits.

The conversion privilege will also be available to the following:

- The surviving spouse and children covered by the group policy after an employee's death;
- Children covered by the group policy once they reach the limiting age; and
- The former spouse of the employee in the case of divorce or annulment.
