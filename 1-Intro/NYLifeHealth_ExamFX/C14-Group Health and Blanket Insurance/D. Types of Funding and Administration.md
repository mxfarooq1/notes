### 1. Conventional Fully-insured Plans

A conventional **fully-insured plan** is administered and guaranteed by an insurance company. In return for the premium collected from the insured by the insurer, the insurer assumes the risk of paying the cost of medical expenses that may or may not occur during the policy period.

### 2. Partially Self-funded Plans

#### Stop-loss Coverage

Stop-loss coverage is a type of funding in an insurance policy that contains a provision that coverage is only activated upon the insured’s losses reaching a certain level (known as a partially-funded plan). It may take the form of a maximum aggregate limit payable or a maximum limit payable for any one event.

#### Administrative Services Only (ASO) Arrangements

An **Administrative-Services Only** (ASO) arrangement is an arrangement in which an insurer agrees to provide certain services to a self-insured entity, such as providing printed claim forms, and the processing and auditing of claims. The insurer does not provide any insurance protection under an ASO arrangement.

A **third-party administrator** (TPA) arrangement is another name for this type of arrangement.
