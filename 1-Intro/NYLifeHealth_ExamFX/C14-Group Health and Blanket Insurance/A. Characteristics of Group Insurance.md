In a group policy, the contract is between the insurance company and the group sponsor (the employer, union, trust, or other sponsoring organization), as opposed to the individual policy, where the contract is between the insurance company and the insured.

### 1. Group Contract

In group insurance, the policy is called the **master policy**, and is issued to the policyowner, which could be the employer, an association, a union, or a trust.

### 2. Certificate of Coverage

The individuals covered under a group insurance plan are issued evidence of coverage in the form of **certificates of insurance**, or certificates of coverage. The certificate of insurance cannot contain provisions or statements that are unfair, misleading or deceptive. The certificate tells what is covered in the policy; how to file a claim, how long the coverage will last, and how to convert the policy to an individual policy.

Know This

The policyowner (employer) receives the master policy; each insured receives a certificate of insurance.

### 3. Experience Rating vs. Community Rating

Group health insurance is usually subject to **experience rating**, where the premiums are determined by the experience of this particular group as a whole. Individual policies are subject to **community rating** or pool rating, where the premium is based upon the overall claims experience of the insurance company. Experience rating helps employers with low claims experience because they get lower premiums.

Know This

Group health insurance uses experience rating for premium determination.

Under the state law (Chapter 501, Regulations 145 and 146), it is mandated that all medical expense health insurance sold to individuals or small groups must be **community rated**. Essentially, all insureds, regardless of age, sex, or occupation, pay the same premium into a predetermined geographic pool, and the claims from that geographic area are paid from the pool's collection. Different rates are permitted for different regions. _For example_, New York City would likely have higher rates per insured than those utilized in Utica. Prior the enactment of this law, **experience rating** was utilized by all commercial carriers which penalized individuals and employers with exorbitant renewal increases based on their poor individual claims experience.
