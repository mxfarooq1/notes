In order to qualify for group coverage, the group must be formed for a purpose other than obtaining group health insurance. In other words, the coverage must be incidental to the group. There are generally 2 types of groups eligible for group insurance: employer-sponsored, and association-sponsored.

### 1. Employment Related Groups

With an **employer-sponsored group**, the employer (a partnership, corporation or a sole proprietorship) provides group coverage to its employees. Eligible employees usually must meet certain time of service requirements and work full-time. The same as group life insurance, group health insurance may be either contributory or noncontributory. With a contributory plan the eligible employees contribute to payment of the premium (both the employer and employee pay part of the premium). If a plan is contributory, at least 50% of all eligible employees must participate in the plan. If the plan is noncontributory, 100% of the eligible employees must be included, and the participants do not pay part of the premium. The employer pays the entire premium. The reason for these participation requirements is to guard the insurer against adverse selection and to reduce administrative costs.

#### Individual Employer Groups

The individual employer normally will provide insurance coverage to all full-time employees. The employer can specify, within some limitations, how many hours are considered full time, and whether both salaried and hourly employees will be covered. The employer can legally exclude a particular group of employees (union or part time, for example) from the eligible class of employees.

#### Professional Employer Organizations

Employers can hire Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) to handle employee management tasks, including employee benefits and payroll, and workers compensation. PEOs achieve this by hiring the client company’s employees. Eventually, the employees of several companies are combined under the umbrella of a single company. This means that the PEO can negotiate better rates on healthcare and workers compensation coverage.

### 2. Associations (Alumni, Professional, Other)

An **association group** (alumni or professional) can buy group insurance for its members. The group must have at least 100 members, be organized for a reason other than buying insurance, have been active for at least two years, have a constitution, by-laws, and must hold at least annual meetings. These groups include, but are not limited to, trade associations, professional associations, college alumni associations, veteran associations, customers of large retail chains, and saving account depositors, to name a few. Association group plans may be either contributory or noncontributory.

### 3. Customer Groups (Depositors, Creditor-debtor, Other)

**Creditor group insurance**, also called credit life and credit disability income insurance, is a specialized use of group life and group health insurance that covers debtors (borrowers). It protects the lending institution from losing money as the result of a borrower’s death or disability. The contract owner is the creditor, such as a bank, a small-loan company, or a credit union. Generally, the debtor is the premium payor, but the lending institution is the beneficiary of the policy. If the debtor dies or becomes disabled, the insurance proceeds are paid to the creditor to liquidate the indebtedness. The amount of insurance cannot exceed the amount of indebtedness.

### 4. Blanket Customer Groups (Teams, Passengers, and Others)

Blanket health insurance operates on the same principles as group health insurance. The only difference is that the insured members are not named. The policy is designed for groups where the membership changes frequently. Some examples include students at a particular school, youths attending a Boy or Girl Scout Camp, sports teams, passengers on a common carrier, and professional employer organizations, among others.

New York law allows the following types of groups to provide blanket accident and health policies for their respective constituents:

1. Railroad, steamship, motorbus, or airplane;
2. Employees exposed to exceptional hazards;
3. Schools and camps;
4. Volunteer fire departments; or
5. Associations.

The major characteristic of blanket insurance is that the individuals who comprise the covered groups are not named on the policies.
