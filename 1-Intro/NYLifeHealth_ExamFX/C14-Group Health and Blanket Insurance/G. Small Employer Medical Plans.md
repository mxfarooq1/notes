As a condition of transacting business in this state with small employers, every small employer carrier is required to actively offer to small employers **at least 2 health benefit plans:**

1. Basic health benefit plan; and
2. Standard health benefit plan.

Basic Care is a managed plan developed in conjunction with the Health Benefit plan committee. The Basic Care is lower in cost than the Standard Benefit Plan. A Standard Benefit Plan is a managed care plan developed in conjunction with the Health Benefit plan committee that provides better benefits at a higher cost than the Basic Care Plan.

### 1. Definition of Small Employer

**Small employer** means any person, firm, corporation, partnership or association that employs a specified number of eligible employees on the date of application for coverage or, in subsequent years, on the date of the determination of renewal rates.

Effective January 1, 2016, under New York law and the Affordable Care Act, the definition of a small employer or small group has been expanded to groups with **1 to 100 employees** (previously 2 to 50). All groups with 1 to 100 employees renewing coverage on or after January 1, 2016 must be issued small group coverage.

A small group health insurance policy **does not include** a policy covering _only_ long-term care benefits, nursing home benefits, home care benefits, dental or vision care services, hospital or surgical indemnity benefits with specific dollar amounts (unless the dollar amounts exceed the amounts required to meet the definitions of basic hospital and basic medical insurance as defined in the Code of Rules and Regulations), accident only indemnity benefits, accidental death and dismemberment benefits, prescription drug benefits, disability income benefits or specified disease benefits.

### 2. Benefit Plans Offered

The catastrophic care benefit plan must provide necessary coverage in the event of catastrophic illness or injury. The state insurance department will establish deductibles and coinsurance requirements at levels that permit options for the insured to obtain affordable catastrophic coverage.

Basic Coverage Benefit Plan is a managed plan developed in conjunction with the Health Benefit plan committee. The Basic Coverage Benefit Plan is lower in cost than the Standard Benefit Plan.

### 3. Availability of Coverage

Insurers cannot restrict or limit coverage for small group health insurance policies. Insurers are allowed, however, to do the following:

- Cover only certain classes of employees based on conditions pertaining to employment, but only if the employer requesting coverage seeks coverage for those classes;
- Establish a required time period of employment before coverage under the employer's plan takes effect;
- Require a number of work hours to qualify as an employee, not to exceed 20 hours per week;
- File overinsurance rules with the Health and Life Policy Bureau and get the Superintendent's approval;
- Establish rules, if more than one health care plan is available, controlling the transfer between the health care plans as long as transfer is permitted at least one time each calendar year;
- Limit enrollment to specified time periods if an eligible employee or dependent rejects initial enrollment;
- Limit changes in coverage to an anniversary date or other regular interval (must be every 12 months or less);
- Limit eligibility if a small group has had health insurance coverage terminated within the previous 12 months for failure to pay premiums.

### 4. Renewability

A long-term care policy issued to an individual must contain a renewability provision that prominently appears on the first page of the policy. Renewal provisions may not be less favorable than **guaranteed renewable** or noncancellable. The insurers who issue LTC policies may not cancel, nonrenew or otherwise terminate coverage solely on the grounds of the age or deterioration in mental or physical health of the insured.

Once accepted, small group coverage cannot be terminated by the insurer due to claims experience. Employees and eligible dependents are entitled to continuation of benefits upon renewal, modification, alteration or amendment of the policy under which the continuation is provided.

The total period of continuation cannot exceed the time periods provided in the original coverage.
