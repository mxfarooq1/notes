### 1. Advertising

Health insurance advertising must be **truthful and not misleading**. Words and phrases may not be used if their meaning is clear only by implication or familiarity with insurance terminology.

In advertisements, insurers cannot use words, phrases, or illustrations that may mislead or deceive applicants or insured regarding any policy premiums, losses covered, or benefit payable. Advertisements must be sufficiently **complete and clear** to avoid deception or the tendency to deceive.

### 2. Regulatory Jurisdiction and Place of Delivery

Group insurance can often provide coverage for employees in more than one state. The question then becomes which state law has jurisdiction over the policy. Generally speaking, the state in which the coverage was delivered would have jurisdiction. Most state laws governing group insurance say that multi-state policies are acceptable if the policy is approved by the issuing state, written in substantial compliance with the laws of the delivery state, and if the laws governing group insurance are substantially similar between the issuing state and the delivery state.
