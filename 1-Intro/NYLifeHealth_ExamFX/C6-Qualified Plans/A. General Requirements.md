An employer-sponsored **qualified retirement plan** is approved by the IRS, which then gives both the employer and employee benefits such as deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth.

Qualified plans have the following characteristics:

- Designed for the exclusive benefit of the employees and their beneficiaries;
- Are formally written and communicated to the employees;
- Use a benefit or contribution formula that does not discriminate in favor of the _prohibited group_ — officers, stockholders, or highly paid employees;
- Are not geared exclusively to the prohibited group;
- Are permanent;
- Are approved by the IRS; and
- Have a vesting requirement.

Qualified plans have tax advantages.

In contrast, **nonqualified plans** are not subject to the requirements regarding participation, discrimination, and vesting as qualified plans. Nonqualified plans require no government approval and are used as a means for an employer to discriminate in favor of a valuable employee with regard to employee benefits. Nonqualified plans accept after-tax contributions.

The table below highlights the differences between qualified and nonqualified retirement plans.
