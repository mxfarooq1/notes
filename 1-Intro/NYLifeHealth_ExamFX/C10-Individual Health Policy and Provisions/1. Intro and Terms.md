By now, you should have a good understanding of health insurance basics. This section will discuss different provisions and riders available in health insurance. Provisions stipulate the rights and obligations of an insurance contract and are fairly universal from one policy to the next. Some provisions are mandatory, and must be included in all policies, while others are optional, and can be included at the discretion of the insurer. In addition, this section will examine the options available to the insurance company and the insured for canceling or renewing coverage. Part of your duty as a producer is to be able to explain the different policy provisions and riders to your clients. The knowledge that you will share with prospective customers will help them make informed decisions about their health insurance coverage.
