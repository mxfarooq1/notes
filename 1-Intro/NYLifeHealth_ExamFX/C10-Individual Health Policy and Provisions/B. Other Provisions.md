## Other Provisions

In addition to the mandatory provisions discussed above, the **insurance company has the option** of including any of the following optional provisions and clauses.

An insurance company may change the wording of the optional policy provisions as long as the rewording is not less favorable to the policyholder.

### 1. Unpaid Premium

Upon payment of a claim, any past due premiums will be deducted from the claim and the policyholder will be paid the net amount.

### 2. Other Benefits

If the insured has 2 or more policies from different companies that provide benefits on an expense-incurred basis, and the policies cover the same expenses, and if the insurance companies were not notified that the other coverage existed, then each insurer will pay a proportionate share of any claim.

The same principle applies when the policy pays specific benefits rather than paying on an expense-incurred basis.

### 3. Cancellation

Within the **first 90 days** after the date of issue, the insurer may cancel a policy by written notice delivered to the insured, or sent by first class mail to the insured's last address as shown by the records of the insurer, stating when the cancellation will be effective, but not less than 10 days thereafter. In the event of cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the pro-rata unearned portion of any premium paid. Cancellation must be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of cancellation.

### 4. Conformity with State Statutes

This provision states that any provision of the policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in which the insured resides on that date, is **automatically amended** to conform to the minimum requirement of the statutes. Although this is an optional provision, most states require that it be included in every health insurance contract issued.

### 5. Illegal Occupation

This provision states that liability will be denied if the insured is injured while committing an **illegal act** or is engaged in an **illegal occupation**.

### 6. Intoxicants and Narcotics

The insurer is not liable for any claims that result while the insured is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs (unless administered by a physician). Treatment for substance abuse is usually a covered benefit under health insurance policies. This provision simply excludes any injury or sickness that results from the insured’s intoxication.
