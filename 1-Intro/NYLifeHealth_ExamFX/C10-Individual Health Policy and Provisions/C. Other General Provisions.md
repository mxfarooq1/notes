## Other General Provisions

All individual health insurance policies are required to include certain standard provisions, called Uniform Mandatory Provisions. In addition to these mandatory provisions, some provisions are required in individual policies, while other provisions are required in both individual and group contracts. Insurers may use additional provisions that are not in conflict with the uniform provisions, as long as they are approved (allowed) by the state where the policy is delivered. Although it is impossible to catalog all of the provisions used by insurers, the following are the more commonly used.

### 1. Right to Examine (Free Look)

This provision allows the insured a period of time to look over a policy once it has been delivered and provides the right to return the policy for any reason. The insured is then entitled to a full refund of all premiums paid. New York law mandates that health policies issued in this state must have a **free-look period** **of** **at least 10, but no more than 20 days.**

### 2. Insuring Clause

The insuring agreement or clause is usually located on the first page of the policy. It is simply a general statement that identifies the basic agreement between the insurance company and the insured. It **identifies the insured** and the **insurance company** and states what **kind of loss (peril) is covered**.

Know This

The insuring clause defines the scope of coverage, as well as identifies the rights and duties of each party of the contract.

### 3. Consideration Clause

The **consideration clause**, which is usually located on the first page of the policy, makes it clear that both parties to the contract must give some valuable consideration. The payment of the premium and the statements in the application are the consideration given by the applicant. The insurer’s consideration is the promise to pay in accordance with the contract terms.

### 4. Renewability Clause

The face page of the individual health insurance contract must clearly state under what conditions the policy may be renewed. If the insurer reserves the right to refuse renewal, the insurer must deliver or mail to the policyholder's last known address a written notice of its intention not to renew the policy beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.

Since individual health insurance policies provide coverage for a specified term, the absence of a cancellation provision does not guarantee continuing protection. Even when the insurer cannot cancel a policy, the insurer may retain the right to refuse to renew the policy.

Each policy should be carefully examined to determine which renewal provision it contains, as these are extremely important provisions.

#### Noncancellable

The insurance company cannot cancel a noncancellable policy, nor can the premium be increased beyond what is stated in the policy (note that the policy may call for an increase in a certain year, such as "age 65," but that must be stated in the original contract). The insured has the right to renew the policy for the life of the contract; the insurer cannot increase the premium above the amount for which the policy was originally issued. However, the guarantee to renew coverage usually only applies until the insured reaches age 65, at which time the insured is usually eligible for Medicare. For disability income insurance, the policy will be renewed beyond the insured's age 65 only if the insured can provide evidence of continuing to work in a full-time job.

Know This

The insured may cancel an insurance policy at any time.

#### Guaranteed Renewable

The **guaranteed renewable** provision is similar to the noncancellable provision, with the exception that the insurer can increase the policy premium on the policy anniversary date. The insured, however, has the unilateral right to renew the policy for the life of the contract. The insurer may increase premiums on a **class basis only** and not on an individual policy. As with the noncancellable policy, coverage generally is not renewable beyond the insured's age 65. **Medicare Supplements** **and** **long-term care policies must be written as guaranteed renewable** contracts, and cannot be cancelled by the company at the insured's age 65.

Know This

A guaranteed renewable policy requires the insurer to continue coverage, as long as premiums are paid.
