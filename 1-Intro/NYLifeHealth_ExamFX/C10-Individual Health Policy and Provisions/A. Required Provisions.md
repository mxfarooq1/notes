The **Uniform Individual Accident and Sickness Policy Provisions Law**, which was developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), has been adopted in all states. This law established standard provisions that are to be included in all individual health insurance policies. Although the wording may differ from one insurer to another, the basic provisions are the same. Some of these provisions are similar to life insurance policy provisions.

The purpose of these provisions is to define the rights and duties of both the insurer and the policyholder. Any of the provisions may be reworded by the insurer, as long as the modification does not make the provision less favorable to the policyholder or beneficiary.

Know This

Insurers must include in individual health insurance policies the standard provisions established under the NAIC's Uniform Individual Accident and Sickness Policy Provision Law.

### 1. Entire Contract; Changes

The entire contract provision states that the health insurance policy, together with a copy of the signed application and attached riders and amendments, constitutes the **entire contract**. No changes may be made to the policy without the express written agreement of both parties, and any changes must also be made a part of the contract. Only an executive officer of the company, not an agent, has authority to make any changes to the policy.

Know This

An insurer is prohibited from making changes to a health insurance policy without an insured's consent.

### 2. Time Limit on Certain Defenses

The **time limit on certain defenses** provision is similar to the _incontestability_ provision found in life insurance policies. No statement or misstatement (except fraudulent misstatements) made in the application at the time of issue will be used to deny a claim after the policy has been in force for **2 years**. If the insurer discovers that the applicant has committed fraud, they may deny a claim any time the policy is in force, even after the first 2 years.

A claim for loss incurred or disability commencing after 2 years from the date of policy issue **may not be reduced or denied** on the grounds that a disease or physical condition, not specifically excluded from coverage, had existed prior to the effective date of coverage.

### 3. Grace Period

The grace period is the period of time after the premium due date in which premiums may still be paid before the policy lapses for nonpayment of the premium. Although the grace period may differ according to individual state laws, in most cases the grace period cannot be shorter than **7 days for weekly premium policies** (industrial policies), **10 days for monthly premium policies**, and **31 days for all other modes**. Coverage will continue in force during the grace period.

Know This

An accident and health insurance policy's grace period is directly tied to the premium payment mode.

### 4. Reinstatement

If the premium has not been paid by the end of the policy’s grace period, the policy will lapse (terminate). This provision stipulates under what conditions the insured may reinstate coverage. Reinstatement is automatic if the company or an authorized representative accepts the policy premium and does not require a reinstatement application. However, if a reinstatement application is required and a conditional receipt is issued for the payment of the policy premium, the company may approve or disapprove the reinstatement application. Coverage is automatically reinstated if not refused within **45 days** from the date the conditional receipt was issued. Accidents will be covered immediately following the reinstatement; however, sickness is covered only after **10 days**. This helps to protect the insurer from _adverse selection**.**_
