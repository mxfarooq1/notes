**Long-term care policies**, which can be marketed in the form of individual policies, group policies, or as riders to life insurance policies, provide coverage for individuals who are no longer able to live an independent lifestyle and require living assistance at home or in a nursing home facility. Long-term care policies can vary in the number of days of confinement covered, the number of home health visits covered, the amount paid for nursing home care, and other contract provisions. They also must provide coverage for at least **12 consecutive months** in a setting other than an acute care unit of a hospital.

### 1. LTC, Medicare and Medicaid Compared

Although Medicare and Medigap policies provide elderly insureds with protection against the cost of medical care, these programs do not provide coverage for long-term custodial or nursing home care. Medicare will cover nursing home care if it is part of the treatment for a covered injury or illness. Medicare and Medicare supplements pay for skilled nursing care, but the coverage is limited. Medicaid does pay for nursing home care, but it provides coverage only for those that qualify with low income and low assets.

### 2. Eligibility for Benefits

Normally to be eligible for benefits from a long-term care policy, the insured must be unable to perform some of the activities of daily living (ADLs). Activities of daily living include _bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring positions_ (also called mobility), _continence,_ and _eating_.

### 3. Levels of Care

Generally, long-term care policies will cover 3 levels of care: skilled nursing care, intermediate care, and custodial care. In addition to these levels of care, the long-term care policy may provide coverage for home health care, adult day care, hospice care or respite care, all of which can be received at home.

#### Skilled Care

**Skilled care** is daily nursing and rehabilitative care that can only be provided by medical personnel, under the direction of a physician. Skilled care is almost always provided in an institutional setting. Examples of skilled care include changing sterile dressing and physical therapy given in a skilled nursing care facility. **Care that can be given by nonprofessional staff is not considered skilled care.**

#### Intermediate Care

**Intermediate care** is occasional nursing or rehabilitative care provided for stable conditions that require daily medical assistance on a less frequent basis than skilled nursing care. It is ordered by a physician, and skilled medical personnel would deliver or monitor this type of care. Intermediate care could be as simple as giving medication to a group in physical therapy once a day or changing a bandage. It may be carried out in a nursing home, an intermediate-care unit or in the patient’s home.

#### Custodial Care

**Custodial care** is care for meeting personal needs such as assistance in eating, dressing, or bathing, which can be provided by nonmedical personnel, such as relatives or home health care workers. Custodial care can be provided in an institutional setting or in the patient’s home. In other words, it involves caring for a person's activities of daily living, and not hospital or surgical needs.

Know This

Skilled care and intermediate care require the assistance of medically licensed personnel. Custodial care may be administered by nonmedical personnel.

### 4. Types of Care

#### Home Health Care

**Home health care** is care provided by a skilled nursing or other professional services in one’s home. Home health care includes occasional visits to the person’s home by registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, licensed vocational nurses, or community-based organizations like hospice. Home health care might include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and medical services by a social worker.

#### Adult Day Care

**Adult day care** is care provided for functionally impaired adults on less than a 24-hour basis. It could be provided by a neighborhood recreation center or a community center. Care includes transportation to and from the day care center, and a variety of health, social and related activities. Meals are usually included as a part of the service.

#### Respite Care

**Respite Care** is designed to provide relief to the family caregiver, and can include a service such as someone coming to the home while the caregiver takes a nap or goes out for a while. Adult day care centers also provide this type of relief for the caregiver.

#### Nursing Home Facility Care

Nursing home care coverage usually pays a specified amount for the time the insured spends in a nursing home, or for medical services received in a setting other than a hospital. Nursing home care is usually provided as one of the following:

- _Skilled nursing care_ — the highest level of nursing care that requires the greatest expertise from the caretaker;
- _Intermediate nursing care_ — similar to skilled nursing care, except for the patient does not require continuous attention; or
- _Custodial care_ — the most basic level of nursing care, which normally requires assistance with the activities of daily living.

#### Assisted Living

**Assisted Living** offers help with nonmedical aspects of daily activities in an atmosphere of separate, private living units. In addition to providing meals, transportation for medical appointments, activities, and pleasure trips, assisted living may provide:

- Linens and personal laundry service;
- Assistance with dressing and bathing;
- Reminders regarding medication; and
- Assistance with eating.

### 5. Benefit Periods

	Long-term care policies usually include an **elimination (waiting) period** similar to those found in disability income policies. Long-term care elimination periods may range from 0 to 365 days _(make sure to check your state-specific requirement in the regulations section)_. The longer the waiting period, the lower the premium. Insurers usually give insureds an option to select the elimination period that best suits their needs. LTC policies also define the **benefit period** for how long coverage applies, after the elimination period. The benefit period is usually 2 to 5 years, with a few policies offering lifetime coverage. The longer the benefit period, the higher the premium will be.

### 6. Benefit Amounts

The benefit amount payable under most LTC policies is usually a specific fixed dollar amount per day, regardless of the actual cost of care. _For example_, if an insured has a fixed daily coverage of $100 and the care facility only charges $90 a day, the insurance company will pay the full amount of $100 a day. Some policies pay the actual charge incurred per day. Most LTC policies are also **guaranteed renewable**; however, insurers do have the right to increase the premiums.

Know This

LTC policies must be guaranteed renewable.

### 7. Optional Benefits

For an additional premium, optional benefits are available with long-term care policies.

#### Indemnity vs. Reimbursement

**Indemnity** is a method of paying benefits to insureds based on a predetermined, fixed rate set for the service provided, regardless of the actual expenses incurred.

**Reimbursement** is a method of paying benefits to insureds based on the actual expenses incurred.

#### Inflation Protection

All long-term care insurance policies must offer policyholders the option of purchasing coverage that raises benefit levels to account for reasonably anticipated increases in the costs of long-term care services covered by the policy.

In the state of New York, insurers must offer each policyholder an inflation protection feature that provides, as a minimum, one of the following benefits:

- Increase of 5% for the annual benefit level;
- The right of the insured to periodically increase benefit levels without providing evidence of insurability or health status (as long as the option has not been declined for 3 consecutive times);
- Coverage for a specified percentage of actual or reasonable charges.

#### Nonforfeiture Benefit

Long-term care policies or certificates issued or delivered in this state must offer to the applicant **nonforfeiture (default or lapse) benefits**. These nonforfeiture values, such as reduced paid-up insurance, may apply to the nursing home benefits or to all benefits provided by the policy. The offer of a nonforfeiture benefit may be in the form of a rider that is attached to the policy. In group long-term care insurance policies, the offer to purchase a policy that includes a nonforfeiture benefit must be made to the group policyholder.

If a policyholder or certificate holder declines the nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer must provide a contingent benefit upon lapse that must be available for a specified period of time following a substantial increase in premium rates.

#### Guarantee of Insurability

Guarantee of insurability option allows the insured to periodically increase benefit levels without providing evidence of insurability. The amount is usually limited to allowing a 5% compounded annual increase.

#### Return of Premium

This optional **nonforfeiture** type benefit is offered by most insurers writing long-term care policies. In the event the insured dies or the policy is lapsed, the insurer will return a certain percentage of the premiums paid.

### 8. Shared Care

A shared care policy is a type of long-term care insurance policy in which a couple pools the benefits of two LTC policies and splits them.

_For example,_ rather than each person buying a 5-year LTC policy, they have 10 years total to use between them. If the husband uses 3 years of LTC, the wife has 7 years left. If the husband uses 6, however, the wife has 4 years left.

### 9. Individual, Group and Association Plans

Long term care insurance is one of the newer forms of insurance. The manner in which coverage is structured and priced is still evolving. Some of the features in the earliest LTC policies were disputed by consumer groups, which led to specific regulations for this form of insurance.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted a model law for consideration by the states, specifying minimum standards for LTC policies. Most states follow this model law.

One of the changes in LTC is the way the product is marketed. In its beginning LTC care was sold only as an individual policy requiring a minimum age of 50 and a maximum age of 69 in order to purchase the policy.

Today LTC coverage is marketed in the following formats:

- Individual policies;
    
- Group policies at the insured's place of employment. Some groups cover employees who are as young as age 18; and
    
- Associations formed for a reason other than to purchase LTC insurance.
    

#### Hybrid Plans

**Long-Term Care (LTC)** coverage, which is often purchased as a separate policy, can also be marketed as a rider to a life insurance policy. These riders provide for the payment of part of the death benefit (called accelerated benefits) in order to take care of the insured’s health care expenses, which are incurred in a nursing or convalescent home. As with the living needs rider, payment of LTC benefits will reduce the amount payable to the beneficiary upon the insured’s death.

Some insurance companies offer **hybrid policies**, which combine whole life insurance and some long-term-care coverage into a single policy. The long-term care insurance component protects financial assets from being drained by long-term care expenses, while the whole life insurance component adds an important retirement asset and funds for the beneficiaries. Hybrid plans may also combine long-term care coverage with an annuity, which allows the insured to receive a guaranteed payment sometime in the future while still living.

### 10. Exclusions

Long-term care policies may have the following **exclusions**:

- Pre-existing conditions or diseases;
- Mental and nervous disorders or disease (except for organic cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, and Parkinson's disease);
- Alcoholism and drug addiction;
- Treatment or illness caused by war, participation in criminal activities, or attempted suicide; and
- Treatment payable by the government, Medicare, workers compensation, or similar coverage.

### 11. Underwriting Considerations

All applications for long-term care insurance policies, except those that cannot be denied based on answers in the application, must contain clear and unambiguous questions designed to ascertain the health condition of the applicant.

Before a long-term care policy can be issued to an **applicant age 80 or older**, the insurer must obtain the following:

- A report of a physical examination;
    
- An assessment of functional capacity;
    
- An attending physician's statement; and
    
- Copies of medical records.
    

### 12. Suitability

In recommending the purchase or replacement of a long-term care insurance policy, an agent must make reasonable efforts to determine the appropriateness of a recommended purchase or replacement.

All insurers that market long-term care insurance must develop and abide by suitability standards to determine whether the purchase or replacement of LTC insurance is appropriate for the applicant’s needs. It is the insurer’s responsibility to train its agents in the use of the suitability standards.
