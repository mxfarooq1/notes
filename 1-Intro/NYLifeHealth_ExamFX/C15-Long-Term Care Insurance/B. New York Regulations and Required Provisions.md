### 1. Renewability

A long-term care policy issued to an individual must contain a renewability provision that prominently appears on the first page of the policy. Renewal provisions may not be less favorable than **guaranteed renewable** or noncancellable. The insurers who issue LTC policies may not cancel, nonrenew or otherwise terminate coverage solely on the grounds of the age or deterioration in mental or physical health of the insured.

### 2. Required Disclosure Provisions

All long-term care policies must disclose and explain the renewability provisions. Any riders or endorsements must also be disclosed in the policy. If the terms usual and customary or reasonable and customary are used, the meaning of those terms must be fully disclosed. Any other limitations or conditions of eligibility for long-term care benefits must be fully disclosed. With regard to life insurance policies that provide an accelerated benefit for long-term care, the policy must include a statement to the effect that receipt of the accelerated benefits may be taxable, and that assistance should be sought from a personal tax advisor.

### 3. Prohibited Practices

State law prohibits any unfair or deceptive trade practices. Knowingly making any misleading representation or incomplete or fraudulent comparison of any insurance policies for the purpose of inducing any person to lapse, forfeit, surrender, terminate, retain, pledge, assign, borrow on, or convert any insurance policy or to take out a policy of insurance with another insurance company is prohibited.

High-pressure tactics and cold lead advertising, in which a person fails to disclose in a conspicuous manner that solicitations of an insurance contract are a purpose of the marketing method, are prohibited.

### 4. Replacement

If a long-term care insurance policy or certificate replaces another, the replacing insurance company **must waive** any time periods applicable to **pre-existing conditions, waiting periods and probationary periods** in the new long-term care policy or certificate for similar benefits to the extent that similar exclusions have been satisfied under the original policy or certificate.

### 5. New York State Partnership for Long-term Care

The **New York State Partnership for Long-Term Care** is a program that combines private long-term care insurance and Medicaid to help New Yorkers prepare financially for the possibility of needing nursing home or home care. The program allows New Yorkers to protect their assets while remaining eligible for Medicaid if their long-term care needs exceed the period covered by their private insurance policy.

If a resident buys a long-term care insurance policy under the Partnership program, and uses 3 years of nursing home care, or 6 years of home care, or some combination, the resident may apply for New York State Medicaid benefits _and still retain all assets._ The person will, however, have to contribute any income to the cost of long-term care.

The Partnership was created to help New Yorkers finance long-term care without impoverishing themselves or signing over their life's savings, with the accompanying loss of dignity. In the long run, the program will help reduce New York's massive Medicaid tax expenditure.

All participating insurance companies are required to offer a **basic (core) policy** which contains the following minimum benefits:

- Nursing home care, home care or a combination of the two (where 2 home care days equal one nursing home day);
    
- Coverage for nursing home care and for home care (up to a specified limit per day);
    
- Inflation protection equal to 3.5% or 5% compounded annually;
    
- Care management: information, referrals, consultation on service needs and benefits;
    
- 14 days of respite care, renewable annually, to give the at-home caregiver some needed rest;
    
- Nursing home bed reservation (20 days per year);
- 60-day grace period to ensure the premium is paid if the insured has designated someone to be notified when the insured fails to pay the premium on time;
- Hospice care;
- Alternate level of care;
- Portability - coverage under the private insurance can be used outside of this state.

The minimum policy duration depends on the type of policy selected. _See Total Asset Protection Plans vs. Dollar for Dollar Asset Protection Plans later in this chapter._

The cost of premiums will depend on the person's age, and the policy and coverage options chosen. Whatever the cost, the premiums will not change based on changes in health status or aging.

#### Total Asset Protection Plans vs. Dollar for Dollar Asset Protection Plans

The New York State Partnership for Long-Term Care offers New York residents 2 different plans:

- **Total Asset Protection Plans:** All assets are protected. These plans are recommended for those with substantial wealth accumulation and/or for those who purchase policies at a younger age; or
- **Dollar for Dollar Asset Protection Plans:** Asset protection is equal to the amount of benefits paid from the policy. These plans are recommended for those with fewer assets since policies may be more affordable.

### 6. Medicaid Estate Recovery Act

The **Medicaid Estate Recovery Act**, part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993, requires states to **recover Medicaid benefits** paid on behalf of Medicaid enrollees. Recovery procedures are initiated after the recipient's death. 

For individuals age 55 or older, states are required to seek recovery of payments from the individual's estate for nursing facility services, home and community-based services, and related hospital and prescription drug services. States have the option to recover payments for all other Medicaid services provided to these individuals, except Medicare cost-sharing paid on behalf of Medicare Savings Program beneficiaries.

Under certain conditions, money remaining in a trust after a Medicaid enrollee has passed away may be used to reimburse Medicaid.

Estate recovery **cannot take place** if at the time of death, the Medicaid recipient has a surviving spouse, a child under the age of 21, or a child of any age who is blind or disabled.

States are also required to establish procedures for waiving estate recovery when recovery would cause an undue hardship.

After OBRA '93 was put into effect, states that had plans approved that disregarded the assets of people who had long-term care insurance policies, must recover all Medicaid costs for nursing facility and other long-term care services from the estates of those people.

New York is among the states that had a plan approved by the time OBRA '93 was enacted and is therefore exempt from seeking recovery from individuals with long-term care insurance policies. For individuals who do not have long-term care insurance, however, the state is required to comply with the estate recovery provisions.

### 7. New York Tax Credit

To encourage businesses and individuals to buy long-term care insurance policies, New York established tax credits for these policies. Currently, the allowable credit is 20% of the premiums paid during the tax year for the purchase of, or for continuing coverage under a qualifying long-term care insurance policy.
