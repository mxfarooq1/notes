_**Key Concepts:**_

- Insurance is defined as the transfer of PURE risk to the insurance company in consideration for a premium.
- The chance of loss without any chance of gain is called pure risk.
- With speculative risk, there is a possibility for gain or loss, so it is not insurable.
- Risk is defined as the chance of loss.
- A condition that could result in a loss is known as exposure.
- A hazard is something that increases the chance of loss.
- The presence of a physical hazard increases the chance of a loss occurring.
- A peril is defined as a cause of loss, such as fire.
- To be insurable, losses must be calculable.
- The law of large numbers allows insurers to predict claims more accurately.
- The law of large numbers applies to groups of people, not to individuals. The more people in the group, the more accurate the predictions are.
- Most insurers buy reinsurance to protect themselves in the event of a catastrophic loss.
- Insurance laws are not required to be uniform from one state to another.

_**Insurers:**_

- A stock insurer may pay dividends to its shareholders (stockholders), but they may not be guaranteed.
- A reciprocal insurance company is managed by an attorney-in-fact.
- An unincorporated association of individuals who insure each other is known as a reciprocal insurer.
- The government offers insurance primarily based upon social needs, such as flood insurance and workers compensation, but does not offer insurance for the purpose of preventing fraud.
- A foreign company has their home office in another state.
- An insurer incorporated outside of the U.S. who sells in the U.S. is an alien company.

_**Producers and General Rules of Agency:**_

- A producer may be personally liable when violating the producer's contract.
- Producers represent the insurance company, not the insured.
- Independent producers own their own accounts and are not insurance company employees.
- Producers have express, implied and apparent authority.
- The authority a producer has that is written into the producer's contract with the insurer is known as express authority.
- A producer's binding authority (if any) is expressed (written down) in the producer's contract with the insurer the producer represents.
- The authority not expressly (written) granted, but is actual authority the producer has to transact normal business activities, is known as implied authority.

_**Contracts:**_

- The elements of a legal contract may be remembered by the acronym C-O-A-L (consideration, offer, acceptance, legal purpose and legal capacity).
- A requirement for a valid contract is offer and acceptance, or mutual agreement.
- Advertising the availability of insurance is not considered to be an offer.
- A specific and definite proposal to enter into a contract is known as an offer.
- The consideration on a policy need not be equal.
- A policy may not be voided due to unequal consideration.
- Under the consideration clause, something of value must be exchanged.
- Because insurance contracts are contracts of adhesion, policy ambiguities always favor the insured.
- Insurance policies are unilateral contracts because only one party makes an enforceable promise.
- The principle of indemnity states the purpose of insurance is to restore the insured to the same position as before the loss occurred.
- The principle of utmost good faith states that all parties to an insurance transaction are honest.
- A representation is defined as the truth to the best of one's knowledge.
- A warranty is defined as a sworn statement of truth, guaranteed to be true.
- A breach of warranty may void a contract.
- Concealment is defined as the failure to disclose a material fact.
- When an insurer voluntarily gives up the right to obtain information that they are entitled to, they have made a waiver.
