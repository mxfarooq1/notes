- A peril is a cause of loss. Health insurance covers two perils: accident and sickness.
- Occupational coverage covers both on-and off-the-job injuries (for those not covered by workers compensation). Nonoccupational coverage covers off-the-job injuries only (for those covered by workers compensation).
- An AD&D policy will pay the capital sum for loss of a limb, in addition to any medical expense insurance coverage that may apply.
- Limited health insurance policies (like AD&D) only cover limited perils and amounts.
- A hospital indemnity policy would pay a stated amount (in addition to any other insurance the insured may have) when the insured is confined in the hospital.
- AD&D and hospital indemnity policies do not follow the principle of indemnity. They pay in addition to other policies the insured may have.
- Credit disability insurance will pay an insured's car payments if the insured is sick or injured and cannot work.
- A blanket disability policy may be written to cover passengers on a common carrier, an employee group, a student group, a debtor group, or a sports team. 
- Blanket policies do not require individual applications, nor are certificates of insurance issued to those covered.  
    

### _**Underwriting:**_

- An application must be in writing and will become part of the policy, when issued.
- If an application is approved and a policy is issued, the producer must collect the premium along with a statement of continued good health.
- Health insurance underwriters often order an attending physician's report in order to determine an applicant's current medical condition.
- Issuing a conditional receipt starts coverage right away if all conditions have been satisfied.
