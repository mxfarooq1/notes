### _Uniform Required Provisions:_

- Mandatory provisions, such as the grace period, protect the insured. Optional provisions, such as probationary periods, protect the insurance company.
- Except for fraud, health insurance policies are incontestable after they have been in force for 2 years.
- The probationary period is different from the time limit on certain defenses provision (incontestability); the maximum probationary period is usually 12 months and the incontestability provision is usually 2 years.
- The incontestability clause protects the insurance company. Under this clause, the company may contest a claim for the first 2 years, but not thereafter unless it can prove fraud. Companies are reluctant to charge fraud, however, since it requires proof of intent to deceive and is difficult to prove.
- The time limit on certain defenses clause is another name for the incontestability clause (generally up to 2 years, except for fraud).
- If a reinstatement application is required, an insured is reinstated when the company says or after 45 days, whichever comes first. When an insured is reinstated, a 10-day probationary period starts for sickness only.
- If no reinstatement application is required, an insured is reinstated effective upon payment of the late premium to either the company or the producer.
- Under the legal actions provision, if a claim is not paid immediately, the claimant must wait at least 60 days before filing a lawsuit for failure to pay. Such suits must be filed within 3 years of the original loss. _Check your state regulations for the time limit in your state_.
- Health insurers should pay individual claims as soon as possible, as specified in a provision known as timely payment of claims.
- The time payment of claims provision allows the claims department time to investigate (maximum of 60 days).
- Claims may be denied if they occur after policy expiration.
- Insurers do not have to pay unsubstantiated claims.
- After receipt of notice of claim, the insurer must send out claim forms.
- If claims forms are not provided by the insurer within the time frame required, the insured can submit proof of loss in writing.

### _Uniform Optional Provisions:_

- The change of occupation provision allows the insurer to change the benefit amount or premium should the insured change occupations during the coverage period.
- Under the misstatement of age clause, it is the benefits that are adjusted, not the premiums.
- To reinforce the principle of indemnity by preventing an insured from collecting more than they actually lost, most disability income policies contain an insurance with other insurers clause, which requires insurers to share a claim proportionately.
- If an insured pays the overdue premium on a lapsed health insurance policy and does not hear from the insurer, the insured is automatically reinstated in 45 days.
- Under the unpaid premium provision, if an insured has a claim in the grace period, the insurer may subtract the overdue premium from the amount of the claim paid.
- A cancellable health insurance policy may be canceled by either the insurer or the insured.
- Cancellation will have no effect on a pending claim.
- The illegal occupations provision would allow an insurer to deny coverage if the insured became injured or died while committing a felony.

### _Other General Provisions:_

- If a health insurance policy can be nonrenewed by the insurer at the end of any policy period, the policy is considered to be optionally renewable.
- On a noncancellable policy, the insurance company cannot change the coverage or the rates, but it does not have to offer renewal.
- If a policy is noncancellable and guaranteed renewable, the company cannot change anything and it must offer renewal.
- On a guaranteed renewable policy, the insurance company cannot change the coverage, but it can change the rates by class (not individually).
- A guaranteed renewable policy is renewable at the option of the insured (by paying the premium) up to a certain specified age (usually age 65), but the insurer may change rates by class.
- A conditionally renewable policy must be renewed if the insured meets the specified conditions.
