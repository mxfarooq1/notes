### _Characteristics of Group Insurance:_

- Groups may not be formed just to buy insurance. They must exist for another reason.
- On noncontributory group plans, 100% of the eligible employees must enroll.
- On contributory group plans, usually 50% of the eligible employees must enroll.
- Group participation requirements are designed to help prevent adverse selection.
- A group insurance contract is between the employer and the insurance company.
- In group insurance, the employer is issued a master policy and employees are issued individual certificates of insurance.
- The state in which a group contract is delivered to the policyholder is generally held to have jurisdiction over all certificates of insurance issued under the contract.
- Group underwriting takes into consideration the average age of the group, the health of the group and persistency factors.
- Group coverage must be written for the benefit of employees and cannot discriminate in favor of highly paid workers.
- Although there are strict regulatory requirements related to what an insurer can and can't do in regard to small group insurance, an insurer CAN legally nonrenew or cancel a small group plan if the employer stops paying the premium.
- Multiple employer trusts (METs) offer group coverage for employers in the same industry.
- Association group insurance has higher administrative costs than other types of group health insurance and is more subject to adverse selection.

### _Eligibility for Coverage:_

- Dependents are eligible to enroll in a group plan when an employee becomes eligible to enroll.
- Employees remain eligible for group coverage even after attaining age 65.
- Employers who have 20 or more employees are required to offer the same health benefits to employees and their spouses who are age 65 or older that they offer to younger employees.

### _Continuation of Coverage under COBRA:_

- Under COBRA, employers with 20 or more employees must allow terminated employees and their dependents to continue their group coverage by paying 102% of the group rate.
- When an employee elects COBRA, the coverage is exactly the same as it was in the group. It is not reduced in any way.
- The maximum period of coverage continuation for termination of employment or a reduction in hours of employment is 18 months.
- The dependents of a deceased or disabled employee may continue group coverage for another 36 months.
- The phrase qualifying events includes death, disability or termination of employment.
- If an employee elects to continue group coverage under COBRA, the employee may still convert to an individual policy without a physical exam when COBRA coverage ends.
