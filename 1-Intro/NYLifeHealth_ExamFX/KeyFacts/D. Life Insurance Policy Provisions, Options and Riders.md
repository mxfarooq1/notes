_**Standard Provisions:**_

- Although producers must sign the application, they are not a party to the contract. It is the responsibility of the producer to explain the policy provisions, riders, and exclusions to the applicant.
- The owner's rights section of a life policy states who has the right to change the beneficiary, who can take a loan, and who can take cash surrender.
- Owners of life insurance policies may temporarily assign their life insurance policy to a bank as collateral for a loan, which is known as a collateral assignment.
- The policy is the sole collateral for a policy loan. Policy loans are not taxable.
- The owner of a life insurance policy may transfer the policy ownership to another person by making an absolute assignment.
- The entire contract includes the policy and anything else attached at issue, such as the application.
- Producers may not make changes to a policy.
- Policy modifications must be in writing and signed by a company officer.
- Under the life insurance free look, a policyowner who returns their policy 5 days after delivery will receive a full refund since the free look is commonly 10 days.
- A policyowner may exercise the free look provision without giving any reason.
- The free-look period (usually 10 days) starts upon policy delivery. If the policy is mailed to the applicant by the company, the free look starts on the date of mailing. This is called constructive delivery.
- Ordinary life insurance has a grace period of 30 days.
- A life insurance policy provision that allows coverage to continue even if the premium is not paid on time is known as the grace period.
- If a terminated employee dies within the grace period of the employer provided group life policy without converting, the full death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary.
- When an insured dies during the grace period without paying the premium due, the face amount will be paid to the beneficiary, less the overdue premium.
- If an insured whose policy has lapsed wants it back, the insured can apply for reinstatement.
- Upon policy reinstatement, the incontestability and suicide clauses start over.
- A life insurance policy that has been surrendered for cash may not be reinstated.
- Life insurance policies are incontestable after they have been in force for 2 years.
- New life insurance policies are contestable for material misrepresentation for the first 2 years.
- Under the misstatement of age provision, if an insurer discovers that an insured has misstated their age on the policy application, the insurer will adjust the premiums and benefits according to the correct age of the insured.
- The misstatement of age provision runs for the duration of the policy.
- Under the misstatement of age clause, if the insured understates their age, the face amount of the policy may be reduced according to the correct age.  
    
- Proceeds of a life insurance policy, left with an insurer, for the benefit of a beneficiary, may NOT be attached by creditors.
- Proceeds cannot be directly paid to a minor child since a minor can't sign a release.
- If the insured dies in an accident, the insurer may order an autopsy to determine that death was not the result of a suicide.
- In most states, suicide is covered after 2 years of policy issue. If an insured dies by suicide within a specified period of time after policy issue, no benefit is payable, but all premiums are refunded to the beneficiary. _Check your state regulations section for the time limit in your state._
- If an insured buys a life insurance policy and dies one month later, the insurer must pay the claim.

### _Beneficiaries:_

- When a policyowner lists a group of people as beneficiaries, it is known as a class designation.
- Life insurance proceeds create an immediate estate for the beneficiary.
- The beneficiary does not have to be of the age of majority (18 or 21, depending upon the state) in order to receive policy proceeds; however, proceeds cannot be directly paid to a minor child since they cannot sign the release.
- If the insured names an individual as their irrevocable beneficiary, the insured cannot change this designation without the beneficiary's consent.
- A revocable beneficiary may be changed at any time by the policyowner.
- A revocable beneficiary has no vested rights under a life policy.
- An irrevocable beneficiary has a vested interest in the policy.
- A contingent beneficiary will receive the policy proceeds if the primary beneficiary dies before the insured.
- Under the common disaster provision, it is assumed that the insured died last.
- If the policy proceeds are paid out in a lump sum, the spendthrift clause will not apply.

### _Policy Loan and Withdrawal Options:_

- Failure to repay a loan will have a permanent effect on cash value accumulation.
- The annual interest on a life insurance loan is added to the amount of the loan as it accrues.
- If an outstanding policy loan, plus interest, exceeds the cash value of the policy, the policy will lapse.
- A loan may be taken from a whole life policy as soon as it develops a cash value.
- The automatic premium loan rider can be added to a whole life policy, but not to a term or credit life policy.
- Partial surrenders are usually allowed in annuities, universal life and variable life policies.

### _Riders:_

- Waiver of premium is a rider that will pay the premium on behalf of a disabled insured, after a short waiting period, until the insured either recovers or dies.
- The waiver of premium rider does not pay a cash benefit to the insured.
- If a parent paying the premium on a child's life insurance policy dies, the provision that allows the premium to be waived is known as payor benefit, NOT waiver of premium.
- If the payor benefit rider is attached to the policy, an insured will not have to worry about premiums being paid if the policyowner dies or becomes disabled.
- The accelerated benefits rider will pay proceeds prior to death for those with a terminal illness.
- The change of insured rider may be utilized by an employer who wants to transfer a key person life insurance policy from one key person to another.
- On a term life rider added to a parent's policy to cover the life of a child, the child's coverage terminates when the child reaches age 18, unless the child converts the rider to permanent coverage.
- When adding a children's term rider to a life insurance policy, all of the insured's children are covered for a single, flat premium charge, no matter how many.
- A level term rider may be added to a parent's life policy in order to insure a child.
- A combination policy that automatically covers all family members, including newborn children (after a short waiting period) at no extra premium charge is called a family policy.
- The guaranteed insurability rider is also known as the guaranteed purchase benefit.
- The guaranteed insurability rider allows the insured to increase coverage periodically without a physical exam.
- If a person purchases a whole life policy and adds a return of premium rider, they will have level coverage from the whole life policy, and increasing coverage from the rider.
- The return of premium rider and the return of cash value rider are both types of increasing term coverage.

### _Nonforfeiture Options:_

- Surrender charges levied by some insurers on annuities and universal life will reduce the amount a policyowner will receive upon cash surrender.
- If a policy with a cash value lapses for nonpayment, the insured has 60 days from the premium due date to select a nonforfeiture option.
- Extended term is the automatic nonforfeiture option.
- When the reduced paid-up nonforfeiture option is selected, the amount of coverage in the new policy is reduced from that of the original policy.
- The reduced paid-up nonforfeiture option may be taken any time there is a cash value.
- The reduced paid-up nonforfeiture option will provide coverage for life.

### _Dividend Options:_

- If an insured with a life insurance policy issued by a mutual insurer allows the insurer to keep the dividends but mail the insured a monthly check, the insured has chosen the interest option.
- On a participating life insurance policy, if the policyowner selects the 1-year term dividend option, the dividend may be used to buy term insurance.

### _Settlement Options:_

- If the policyowner/insured does not designate a settlement option prior to death, the beneficiary may choose their own option. Most choose a lump-sum, cash, payout, which is not taxable.
- If the interest settlement option is selected, the interest paid is subject to taxes.
- When a beneficiary selects the interest only settlement option, interest payments (which are taxable) will vary, but the beneficiary may withdraw the principal at any time.
- For estate conservation purposes, a beneficiary should select the interest only settlement option.
- A life insurance beneficiary who elects to take the death benefit payable over a period of time has selected the fixed period settlement option.
