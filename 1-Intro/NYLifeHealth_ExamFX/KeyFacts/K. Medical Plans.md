### _Medical Plan Concepts:_

- Major medical insurance is considered to be a comprehensive insurance plan.
- The purpose of preadmission certification is to eliminate unnecessary treatment, thereby lowering premiums (cost saving).
- Medical expense policies are required to cover the insured's newborn child from the moment of birth.
- On medical expense insurance, the scheduled benefit limit shown is the most that the insurer will pay.

### _Types of Providers and Plans:_

- The term health care service organization (HCSO) may be used in place of the term health maintenance organization (HMO).
- An HMO primary care physician makes referrals, authorizes treatment, provides general care and acts as the gatekeeper between HMO members and their health care providers.
- Health care service organizations (HCSOs) stress preventive care.
- HCSOs pay reimbursements to their providers directly, not to their insureds.
- When a doctor works in an independent group clinic on behalf of an HCSO, it is known as a group practice model.
- HMO primary care physicians may include those in family practice, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, but not internists.
- HMOs usually don't cover adult hearing exams as a preventive care service.
- Except for emergencies, HMO services must be provided in-network.
- HMOs cover out-of-network emergency treatment without pre-authorization, although providers must notify the HMO after treatment has been rendered.
- The term managed care includes medical services provided by HMOs, PPOs and POS (point-of-service) plans, but does not include indemnity plans.
- Medical expense claims are often paid on a fee-for-service basis.
- Major medical expense policies often have a comprehensive calendar year deductible.
- In utilization management, pre-certification is different than a concurrent review because pre-certification is done prior to treatment.
- Basic medical expense plans cover in-hospital only, with first dollar coverage. There is no deductible or coinsurance, but coverage is subject to inside (maximum) limits.
- Major medical and comprehensive major medical plans have deductibles and coinsurance requirements.
- The stop loss feature on a major medical policy applies after the insured first pays the deductible. It limits that amount of coinsurance the insured has to pay on a large claim.
- Medical expense policies are usually written as cancellable, which means the company can cancel at any time as long as it gives advance notice.
- Medical expense policies usually contain a probationary period that applies to pre-existing conditions, meaning they won't be covered if they occur during this period.
- A family deductible limits the total amount the family must pay during the year no matter how many family members become sick or injured.
- The assignment of benefits provision on medical expense insurance facilitates claims handling by allowing the insurer to pay benefits directly to the provider.
- When calculating how much the company will pay on a claim, always subtract the deductible, first then apply the coinsurance percentage.
- PPO subscribers who go out of network for services will receive reduced benefits.
- To encourage an insured who is covered by a point-of-service (POS) plan to seek coverage in network, out-of-network coverage is often subject to higher deductibles.

### _Cost Containment in Health Care Delivery:_

- On medical expense plans, a mandatory second opinion requirement will result in fewer claims.
- A carry-over deductible applies to claims that occur during the last 3 months of the calendar year. They carry over and apply to next year's deductible.
- If an insurer wants to stress preventative care, they should waive the deductible for office visits.
