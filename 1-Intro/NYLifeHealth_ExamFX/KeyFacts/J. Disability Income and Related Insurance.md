- As defined in a disability income policy, the insured is considered to be totally disabled if the insured cannot perform their own job for the first 2 years, and any job that the insured is suited to do thereafter.
- Those collecting disability income insurance benefits may be required to take a physical exam every 6 months at the insurer's expense in order to prove that they are still disabled.
- Those who suffer from presumptive disabilities, such as loss of eyesight, are not required to take a physical exam in order to prove that they are still disabled.
- The primary purpose of disability income insurance is the replacement of lost wages, should the insured become disabled.
- The most important factor to consider when writing disability income insurance is the amount of wages that could be lost.
- On a disability income policy, a longer elimination (waiting) period will reduce the premium.
- The waiting period is like a deductible, except it is stated in terms of time rather than in dollars.
- The waiting period starts at the onset of an insured's disability.
- Short-term disability policies have shorter elimination and benefit periods than long-term disability.
- If a disability income policy has a 7-day elimination period and the insured is sick for 15 days, the insured would receive benefits for 8 days.
- The probationary period starts when the policy is first issued.
- A recurrent disability is a prior injury that reoccurs again. The elimination (waiting) period is waived.
- A residual disability is one that never goes away. Residual coverage pays the difference between what an insured used to make before their disability and what they can make now.
- If a disability income policy contains an accidental means clause, there is no coverage if an insured is injured doing something they meant to do.
- If a disability income policy contains an accidental bodily injury clause, coverage applies as long as the injury was unintentional and unforeseen.
- The guaranteed purchase option is a rider that allows the insured to purchase additional coverage at certain intervals, regardless of health.
- The cost of living rider on a disability income policy is designed to keep the policy limit up with the rate of inflation.

### _Group and Business Disability:_

- Group disability income is written to cover only a percentage of an employee's gross earned income.
- Individual disability income is written to cover only a percentage of an insured's net (after-tax) earned income.
- Key person disability insurance indemnifies the business for the loss of services of a key employee due to disability.
- Business overhead insurance will cover the ongoing business expenses of a self-employed person, such as rent or salaries, while the sole proprietor is disabled. Premiums are tax deductible, but benefits are taxable.
- A disability buy/sell policy could be structured to pay a monthly benefit to a corporation for up to 1 year while waiting to see if a disabled partner recovers. If not, then a lump sum is paid as a partnership buyout.

### _Social Security Disability:_

- OASDHI (Old Age, Survivors, Disability and Health Insurance) is an acronym for Social Security.
- Social Security disability income benefits are harder to obtain than benefits provided by private disability income insurers.
- To have fully insured status under Social Security for disability benefits, a worker must have contributed to Social Security for at least 40 quarters (10 years).
- A disabled person must have fully insured status in order to be eligible for Social Security disability benefits.
- The waiting period for Social Security disability benefits is 5 months.
- Social security disability benefits require that a disabled person cannot work ANY job, and that the disability is expected to last at least 1 year or result in death.
