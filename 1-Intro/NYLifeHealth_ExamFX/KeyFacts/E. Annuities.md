### _Annuity Principles and Concepts:_

- A contract that will pay a specified indemnity to its owner over a period of time is an annuity.
- Annuity tables are different than mortality tables since there is no insurance protection.
- Insurers take the money from annuitants who die too soon and pay it to those who live too long.
- If an insured dies during the accumulation period of an annuity, the account value will be paid to the insured's beneficiary, who is responsible for taxes on interest earned.
- The rights of ownership on an annuity become effective as of the contract date.
- The annuitant is the party whose life the benefits are based upon.
- Although annuity benefits paid to a beneficiary are usually taxable upon the death of the owner/annuitant, beneficiaries who are spouses may continue the contract on a tax deferred basis as the contingent owner.
- Endowments provide life insurance protection. Annuities do not.
- Annuities are the opposite of life insurance. Life insurance creates an estate. Annuities systematically liquidate an estate over a period of time.
- All annuities are insurance products, although often sold by bankers with Life insurance licenses.
- Annuities are often used as life insurance settlement options.

### _Immediate vs. Deferred:_

- An immediate annuity begins paying out immediately after the initial premium is paid.
- The premium for a $100,000 immediate annuity is $100,000, regardless of the annuitant's age, health or gender. It is the payout that depends on these factors.
- Single premium immediate annuities (SPIAs) are often purchased with a lump sum upon retirement.
- In order to be considered a single-premium deferred annuity, there must be a period longer than one benefit payment interval before payments begin.
- A flexible-premium fixed deferred annuity has a flexible premium, minimum guaranteed rate of return and a death benefit equal to its cash value.
- Deferred annuities are purchased by making periodic payments over a period of time.
- A deferred annuity can only be surrendered for cash during its accumulation (pay-in) period.
- The owner of an annuity is responsible for paying the premium.
- When a policyowner surrenders an annuity for cash, they have exercised a nonforfeiture option.
- During the surrender period of an annuity, the surrender value is less than the contract's cash value.
- The surrender charge on an annuity is sometimes referred to as a back-end load.
- Annuities waive surrender charges for death or disability.
- The death benefit on an annuity during the accumulation period is equal to its cash value.

### _Annuity (Benefit) Payment:_

- If the owner of a life income annuity with a 10-year period certain dies 13 years after the contract has annuitized, the beneficiary will receive nothing.
- One cannot outlive the income from a life annuity.
- A life income annuity (straight or pure life annuity) has no beneficiary, and is the riskiest choice.
- A life annuity does not start making payments at death. Payments stop at death.
- On a joint life annuity, payments stop when the first annuitant dies.
- A refund annuity has the least amount of risk.
- An annuitant would select the period certain annuity pay-out option if the annuitant wanted payments to continue to a beneficiary after the annuitant's death.
- If an annuitant selects a pay-out option that will pay for a specified period of time, the annuitant has selected the fixed-period option.

### _Fixed vs. Variable Annuities:_

- The primary challenge faced by those that purchase fixed annuities is purchasing power risk, since the rate of return is fixed.
- The rate of return that an insurer pays on a fixed annuity might not keep up with inflation.
- Fixed annuities guarantee a fixed rate of return and are backed by the state guaranty fund.
- Fixed annuities are backed by the insurer's general account.
- Fixed annuities usually pay an interest rate that is similar to other types of conservative investments.
- An annuity which has a rate of return that is based on an index of equity products is an equity-indexed annuity.
- Equity-indexed annuities (EIAs) have little purchasing power (or inflation) risk since their rate of return is based in part on an equity (stock) index, such as the S&P 500.
- On a market value adjusted annuity, the contract will pay the specified interest rate if it is held for a specific period of time. Adjustments are only made if the contract is surrendered early.

### _Uses of Annuities:_

- Employers may use annuities to fund deferred compensation plans, but not corporate pension plans.
- Lottery payouts and structured settlements are often funded by annuities.
- A self-employed person cannot use an annuity to fund a 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity (TSA).
- A 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity (TSA) is funded by making voluntary before-tax contributions.
- 403(b) TSAs are owned by the employee, not the employer.
- A corporation cannot use an annuity to build tax-deferred growth on corporate assets. Only individuals are entitled to tax deferred annuity earnings.
- Most immediate annuities are purchased by those who wish to supplement their retirement income.
- Most annuities are used for retirement purposes and are considered to be long-term investments.
- One purpose of an annuity is to keep customers from outliving their savings.
- When recommending a variable annuity, the agent should inquire about the applicant's tax status.
- Producers selling annuities must have reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction is suitable based upon a customer's financial status, tax status and investment objectives.
