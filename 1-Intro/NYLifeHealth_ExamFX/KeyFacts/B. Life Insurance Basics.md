_**Underwriting:**_

- Life insurance mortality tables are based upon people and time.
- A 60-year-old male has a higher mortality rate than a 60-year-old female.
- Life insurance premiums are based on mortality (death) plus company expenses minus interest earned on company investments.
- Agents (producers) are also known as field underwriters.
- If a producer gives an applicant a conditional receipt and the underwriter rejects the application, there is no coverage.
- Conditional or binding receipts are used in life and health insurance. Binders are used in property and casualty insurance.
- A conditional receipt is not given to an applicant unless the initial premium has been paid.
- Applicants may backdate a life insurance application for up to a specified number of months (usually 6 months) in order to obtain a lower premium.
- An incomplete application is usually returned. However, should the underwriter approve it, coverage begins and the company has waived its ability to contest a claim.
- The earliest that coverage could start would be the day of application, assuming the applicant paid the first premium, had no conditions to fulfill, and had not lied on the application.
- Coverage can NEVER begin unless the premium has been paid.
- The HIV consent form states that the results of an HIV test will only be shared with certain individuals, such as the underwriter.
- Life insurers may discriminate based upon physical hazards (age and health) of the applicant.
- The company underwriter determines the final rating classification, not the producer.
- A preferred risk is likely to receive a premium discount.
- A standard risk is one with an average life span. Most applicants are standard risks.
- A rated policy is one issued to a substandard risk with dangerous hobbies or health problems.
