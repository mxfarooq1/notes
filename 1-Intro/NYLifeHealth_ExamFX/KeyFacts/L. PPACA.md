### _Affordable Care Act:_

- The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) is commonly called the Affordable Care Act (ACA for short).
- ACA requires children to remain dependents on their parents' health insurance policy up until age 26, regardless of dependency, marital status, or college status.
- Health insurance policies cannot exclude pre-existing conditions.  
    
- The Marketplaces are electronic websites that allow both individuals and small businesses a place to procure health insurance coverage.
- Premiums may vary based upon the following factors:
    - Age (older people may be charged more than young people);
    - Geographic location;
    - Tobacco use; or  
        
    - Individual vs. family enrollment.
- The Marketplaces are designed to determine if a person qualifies for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Plan.
- The Marketplaces are also designed to determine if a person qualifies for cost reduction measures.
- These two cost reduction measures are only available if coverage is purchased through a Marketplace.
- Policies sold on the Marketplace include 5 levels of coverage: 4 metal levels - Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, and a catastrophic plan.
- The metal levels of coverage provide identical coverage; the differences are found in how much the insurer covers (actuarial value), and how much the policy costs (premium).
- The Premium Tax Credit would apply to any level of coverage purchased (except catastrophic).
- Catastrophic coverage may only be purchased in certain situations.
- The ACA requires health benefit plans to include coverage for 10 essential health benefits.
- The ACA does not require a small business with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees to provide health coverage to its employees.
- The coverage offered to employees must also include an offer of coverage for the employee's dependents.
- A spouse is not considered a dependent.
- A full-time employee under the ACA is one who works 30 hours or more on average, per week.
- An employer that offers health coverage to only employees but not dependents may also face a penalty.
- A full-time employee may elect to purchase coverage through the Marketplace for the following reasons: coverage was not offered to this employee, the coverage offered did not provide a minimum value, or the coverage offered was not affordable.
