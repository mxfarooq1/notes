### _Taxation of Personal Life Insurance:_

- Death benefits paid to beneficiaries are tax free on all life insurance.
- Dividends which are paid out by mutual insurers are not taxable to the policyowner because they are considered to be a return of the premium paid by the policyowner.
- Dividends received by the owner of stock in a stock company are taxable as ordinary income. Dividends are NEVER taxed as capital gains.
- A cash surrender where the amount received is more than amount paid in in premiums would cause a taxable event.
- Surrendering a life insurance policy for cash and using the proceeds to buy a new life insurance policy from a different insurer is a tax-deferred 1035 exchange.
- On cash surrender of a life insurance policy, amounts received in excess of premiums paid in are taxable.
- In group life insurance, benefits are NOT taxable to the beneficiary should the employee die.
- Premiums paid for individual life insurance are NOT tax deductible, nor are benefits taxed. This is true of key person life insurance as well.
- Life insurance policyowners who gift their policies to a charity are entitled to a tax deduction in the year of the gift.

### _Modified Endowment Contracts (MECs):_

- Modified endowment contracts (MECs) lose their favored tax treatment as life insurance since the IRS considers them to be investments.
- MECs are classified that way for the life of the contract.
- A modified endowment contract that is classified as life insurance but fails the 7-pay test would have taxable loans and withdrawals.
- Making a material change to a cash value life insurance policy may cause the 7-pay test to be applied again and could cause the policy to be classified as a modified endowment contract.
- Modified endowment contracts have a 10% IRS penalty for premature distributions.
