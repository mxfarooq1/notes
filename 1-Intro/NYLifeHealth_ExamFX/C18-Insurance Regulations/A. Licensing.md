#### Agents

An insurance agent is a person authorized by an insurer, fraternal benefit society or health maintenance organization (HMO) to solicit, negotiate and obtain insurance, HMO or annuity contracts. The agent represents **the insurer, not the insured.**

The following are **excluded** from this definition:

#### Brokers

An insurance broker is any person, firm, association or corporation who solicits, negotiates, or obtains insurance for an insured (other than him/herself) in exchange for a commission. A broker represents the **insured, not the insurer,** and acts in the best interest of the insured. The following are excluded from this definition:

- Officer, director or regular salaried employee of an insurer;

Public adjusters are required to complete **15 credit hours of continuing education** every license renewal period (biennially). All adjusters must file a surety bond of $1,000 with the Superintendent before a license may be issued or renewed.

#### Nonresident

A nonresident insurance agent or nonresident insurance broker is an individual who is a resident of another state, who is licensed or authorized to act as an agent or broker in the state of New York.

Applicants may qualify for a license as a nonresident only if they hold a similar license in another state or foreign country. Licenses issued to nonresidents by the Superintendent grant the same rights and privileges as resident licenses. This is called **reciprocity.** Nonresidents are not required to take a written examination.

If a person licensed in another state moves to New York and wants to become a resident agent or broker, the person must **apply for a license within 90 days** of the cancellation of the applicant's previous license. As long as the licensee was in good standing at the time of cancellation, the licensee may not have to fulfill prelicensing or examination requirements for lines of authority held in the previous state, unless the Superintendent determines otherwise.

#### Business Entities

A business entity is a corporation, association, partnership, limited liability company, limited liability partnership or other legal entity. Before any original insurance agent's or broker's license is issued, the prospective licensee must apply to the Superintendent. The application must contain information concerning the business entity. The licensee is responsible for the business entity's compliance with New York state insurance laws and regulations.

#### Temporary

A temporary license may only be used to service **existing business**, not to solicit, negotiate or procure new business. The Superintendent may issue a temporary license to an agent or broker or both **without** requiring an examination, in the following cases:

- To the surviving spouse, next of kin or court appointed personal representative of an agent who dies, or becomes mentally or physically disabled;
    
- To a member or employee of a business entity licensed as an insurance agent upon death, disability, or termination of a designated individual in the business entity; or
    
- To the designee of an agent entering active military service.
    

The temporary license may be issued for a term of not more than **90 days** unless the Superintendent renews additional 90-day terms, not to exceed an aggregate of **15 months**. In the case of military service, the temporary license may continue up to 60 days after the discharge from service.

### 4. Maintenance and Duration

#### Renewal

Producer licenses will remain in effect unless suspended or revoked, as long as they are properly renewed. Insurance agent's or broker's license must be renewed **every 2 years**. The licenses of insurance agents or brokers born in odd-numbered years will expire on their birthdays in odd-numbered years. The licenses of insurance agents or brokers born in even-numbered years will expire on their birthdays in even-numbered years.

An agent or a broker must file an application for renewal of license with the Superintendent at least **60 days** before the license expires. If it is submitted late, the applicant will be subject to a late filing fee of $10.

The current license remains in effect until the Superintendent issues or denies the renewal license. Before a license can be denied, the Superintendent must notify the applicant of intentions to deny or nonrenew and give the applicant a hearing. If a renewal license is denied, the current license will expire 5 days after the licensee is notified.

#### Continuing Education

Continuing education (CE) rules are established to protect the public by maintaining high standards of professional competence in the insurance industry, and to maintain and improve the insurance skills and knowledge of licensed producers.

To renew a license, any resident or nonresident agent or broker must complete **15 hours** of instruction by an approved provider of continuing education biennially (**every 2 years**). This continuing education requirement applies to agents and brokers licensed in life insurance and annuity contracts, sickness, accident and health insurance, all lines of property and casualty insurance.

Excess credit hours accumulated during any biennial licensing period cannot be carried over to the next period for the same class of license.

The course programs of instruction must be approved by the Superintendent. The providers must file for approval biennially. Each licensee must pay a fee of $10 per license for continuing education certificate filing and recording charges.

#### Assumed Names

Every licensee must notify the Superintendent upon changing of legal name. Except for an individual licensee's own legal name, licensees may not use any name unless it has been previously approved by the Superintendent.

#### Change of Address

The Department of Financial Services must be notified **within 30 days** of any change of address: residence, business, or email.

#### Reporting of Actions

A licensee must report any **administrative action** taken against him or her in another jurisdiction or another state within **30 days** of the final disposition of the matter. The report, filed with the Superintendent, must include a copy of any relevant legal documents.

Within **30 days** of the initial pretrial hearing date, a licensee subject to this article must report to the Superintendent any **criminal prosecution** of the licensee taken in any jurisdiction.
