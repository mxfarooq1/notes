_The information in this section will provide you with a greater understanding of important topics; however, it will not appear on the state exam._

### 1. Ethics in the 21st Century

#### Ethics: Principles and Practices

The purpose of this part of the course is to provide the foundation of knowledge and understanding that an individual needs to function ethically in his or her role as an insurance professional. Our concentration will be on the social, professional, and legal aspects of ethics.

It seems that in many news reports that a person reads or listens to these days, some insurance company or insurance agent is receiving negative publicity as a result of bad professional judgment or poor ethical conduct. Bad news usually attracts far more attention than that paid to the legions of insurance agents who perform their daily sales and service tasks in a thoughtful, fair, and ethical manner. Their exemplary work will be discussed in detail.

As you will discover, ethics can be studied on two levels:

1. **Philosophically,** where a code of personal ethics helps you gain personal and professional satisfaction; and
2. **Practically,** where a code of personal ethics helps you avoid controversy and misunderstandings, which increases your personal efficiency as an agent.

#### Understanding Ethics

At some time in your life, you've been exposed to the Golden Rule that states: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Either taught by a parent, a teacher, or a religious leader, this golden rule not only promises spiritual satisfaction and fulfillment, but it also serves as a practical guide to an insurance agent's everyday business life.

To a certain extent, ethics is a set of instructions on how to deal daily with a group and a community. These instructions revolve around a single theme: "social behavior that favors the group over the individual." Antisocial behavior usually stems from individual selfishness and greed characteristics that are against the common good and disruptive to overall balance and harmony. Because ethical behavior on the part of the individual resulted in group harmony, communities turned to such ethics as the basis for common law, which in turn became the basis for our own civil and criminal codes of conduct.

Today, we live in a fast-paced society. Unfortunately, this pace does not always give us the necessary time to consider different choices of action or reflect upon the consequences of our words and deeds. This can create ethical problems. Moreover, some people tend to focus on practical and expedient solutions to their problems when their main consideration should be the ethical answer. In these situations, the practical solution may not be correct, and the cure could result in a condition worse than before.

#### Ethics Defined

**Ethics** is a derivative of the Greek word _ethikos,_ meaning "moral" and _ethos,_ meaning "character." By textbook definition, ethics is "a branch of philosophy that deals with the values of human life in a coherent, systematic, and scientific manner." The Oxford English Dictionary defines ethics as "the department of study concerned with the principles of human duty" and the "rules of conduct recognized in certain associations or departments of human life."

You won’t find universal agreement among philosophers as to what, exactly, is ethically right. Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher, believed what is right is based on pure reason. On the other hand, Jeremy Bentham, early 19th-century British philosopher, believed _right_ to be that which will produce the greatest good. Religious philosophers, like St. Thomas Aquinas, say that _right_ is determined by the will of God, and _wrong_ is anything contrary to God’s will.

For the purpose of our work, we will use Albert Schweitzer's definition of ethics:

_Ethics is the name we give to our concern for good behavior. We feel an obligation to consider not only our own personal well-being but also that of others and of human society as a whole._

Dr. Schweitzer, who was a French medical missionary and philosopher, applied this idea of "duty beyond the group" to all humanity. He believes that the ultimate goal of ethics is the fullest measure of justice for all. If we were to distill the philosophy of Dr. Schweitzer into three words, they would be "regard for others."

#### The Golden Rule

The Chinese philosopher Confucius said that ethics is the foundation of peace in a society. He believed that a body politic of "good brothers" living in moral harmony would result in an orderly and peaceful nation. The golden rule, in fact, comes from Confucius, who said, "What you do not want others to do to you, do not do to others."

The golden rule provides us with the most basic test concerning ethical conduct. You can easily determine whether a course of conduct is ethical simply by asking, "Would I want someone else to act in this manner toward me?"

It is interesting to note that this same test is a guidepost of the Chartered Life Underwriter: proposing a life insurance solution (to a client's problem) that you yourself would purchase.

Failure to apply the golden rule will result in two separate standards of ethics. One standard is how you treat others; the second is how you expect others to treat you.

#### Ethics—A Way of Life

When we discuss ethics, we are not dealing with a set of hard-and-fast scientific rules, but rather with attitudes, ideas, and beliefs. Ethics is really a set of instructions for a way of life. Ethics presents an individual with a way to live harmoniously with others.

Ethics, like religion, favors the group over the individual. Quite simply, if the individual is completely self-seeking, then the group will most likely suffer. The phrase "Love thy neighbor as thyself" is pure ethics; it serves as a brake on antisocial behavior.

Ethical business practices, in turn, can help foster satisfied customers, as well as a stable economy. In this context, ethics is about social justice, making sure that people receive benefits from every decision made.

#### How Do We Define Success?

Unfortunately, our society isn't always critical of wrongdoing. For example, many people are impressed with the wealth accumulated by some individuals and ignore the means by which it was gained.

This tendency to emphasize personal financial gain is a common way many businesses, including the insurance industry, motivate their employees. Financial gain is often held out as the primary measure of success. This is not to say that pursuit of financial gain is wrong; however, consider how incentives such as "Top Agents of the Month" rosters have the tendency to spotlight financial achievement while ignoring professionalism and public service. What about an agency atmosphere that stresses results by any means? Shouldn't those who have achieved ethical success, those who have best served the needs of their insurers and the public, be honored, too? An overemphasis on financial rewards can lead to looking at prospects and clients on the basis of "What can I get from them?" as opposed to "What I can do for them?"

Certainly, insurance agents should expect to be adequately rewarded for success, and production figures are vital to the well-being of any agency or insurance company. However, no less important is meeting the needs of clients and the public in a proper and ethical manner. Self-interest is fine, but not when maintained at any cost, not at the cost of your self-respect and not at the cost of others.

#### The Ethical Balance Sheet

Ethics does not have to be incompatible with capitalism. "Profit" is not a dirty word. In the long run, good ethics is indeed good business. Hard but fair competition cannot help but benefit the public.

Selling life insurance is an aggressive profession accustomed to vigorous competition. In fact, that vigorous competition leads to a better serving of the public's needs. Applying the golden rule does not mean that you should allow someone else to make the sale, hoping that he or she might let you make the next one. If someone asked you to sign a written agreement after telling you what the document contained, it would not be unethical to read the document anyway before signing. Ethics is personal in nature and does not demand that you trust others implicitly. You have no control over the conduct of others, only over your own.

#### Ethics as a Legal Force

For some, there is a conflict because ethics deals with the way things **ought to be**, which is not necessarily practical in our society. These individuals get wrapped up in differences between ethical and legal - two completely separate concepts. Ethics is right for rights sake, while the law represents a set of minimum standards that society demands.

Ethics usually precedes the law. While many ethical standards of conduct have been codified, many have not. So something can be legal but not ethical. _For example_, it is legal to sell a prospect more life insurance that he or she can afford, but this is not ethical. Ethics goes beyond the letter of the law and entails not only what a person "must do" but also what a person "should do."

However, it should be noted that the law does not provide a very specific ethical direction for everyone through civil and criminal statutes. Under the law, ethical conduct is generally defined as that which a reasonable person is expected to follow under any circumstances. Also defined in the law are illegal and improper conduct and the penalties for such conduct.

In spite of this merger of the legal and ethical, there is still a distinction between the two. How often have your heard people ask, "Well, were my actions illegal?" And when they were told that their actions were perfectly legal, they assumed that their actions were also acceptable.

The integrity and truthfulness of a company’s policies are subject to scrutiny by the general public. Public pressure may force a business to revise its practices. All of this means that what is legal today--but unethical--could become illegal tomorrow, depending on changes by the community to bring reform.

However, relying on legalities alone can become the easy way out. Paying attention to "have-to" rules and regulations at the expense of "choose-to" ethical standards can keep the individual out of legal trouble but can also result in a delusion of success. Ethics has more to do with approval from the man or woman in the mirror than it does with approval from one’s manager or the insurance company that one represents.

#### Honesty

In our modern society, it may not be possible for an individual to live in an absolutely honest manner. Completely honest people who refused to tell white lies to protect the feelings of others would have few friends. However, there is a big difference between telling your Aunt Betty that you love her atrocious new hairstyle and telling a client that he/she needs more life insurance than is actually necessary.

### 2. Ethics for Insurance Agents

#### Consider These Questions

Is it ethical for an insurance agent to use for a prospect list the names of individuals who registered for a new home in a supermarket drawing?

Is it ethical for an insurance agent to call himself or herself a financial planner or an estate planning specialist without the proper training, experience, or qualifications?

Is it ethical for an insurance agent to show a prospect a policy illustration without explaining the difference between guaranteed and nonguaranteed benefits?

Of course, the answer to all of these questions is "no." None of these situations shows proper ethical behavior by an insurance agent. No matter how extreme these examples might seem, they represent ethical responsibilities that an insurance agent is expected to fulfill. An agents four primary ethical responsibilities are to the following:

1. Insurer;
2. Policyowners;
3. General public; and
4. State.

Each of these areas will be discussed in detail in the following sections, but let's take a brief look at them now.

#### Ethical Responsibilities to the Insurer

The duties of an insurance agent to his or her insurer are established by the concept of agency. This concept is tangibly represented by the agency contract, which both parties agree to and sign. Within the scope of that contract, the insurance agent owes to his or her insurer the duties of honesty, good faith, and loyalty. He or she also is obligated to reveal to the insurer all material facts concerning the agency.

In carrying out his or her duties, the insurance agent is the direct representative of the insurer. His or her day-to-day activities are a direct reflection on the insurer's image within the community. Should the agent behave unethically, everyone in that community is given to believe that the insurer is also unethical.

#### Ethical Responsibilities to Policyowners

The professional agent can meet his or her ethical responsibilities to an insured policyowner by filling needs and providing quality service. Service is a primary function of the insurance industry. The way that service is provided often determines the agent's future, since clients are a good source for future sales and references.

In addition to quality service, the agent also owes the policyowner the same degree of loyalty that he or she provides to the insurer. The agent is also charged with the ethical responsibilities of full disclosure, confidentially, timely submission of all applications, and prompt policy delivery.

#### Ethical Responsibilities to the Public

The insurance agent has more control over the public's attitude toward insurance than sales representatives for most other consumer products. This is because the insurance agent initiates contact with a prospect, determines a prospects need for insurance, recommends a certain product or solution, makes the sales presentation, and finally develops a long-term relationship with after-sale service. In many cases, the prospect has little or no direct contact with the insurance company.

Because this special relationship involves a great deal of contract between the consumer and agent (and because the public generally understands very little about insurance), public perceptions of the industry itself are based on how well, or how poorly, an agent does his or her job. Thus, the professional insurance agent has two main ethical responsibilities to the public:

1. To inform the public about insurance with the highest level of professional integrity; and
2. To strive for an equally high level of professionalism in all public contacts in order to maintain a strong, positive image of the industry.

#### Ethical Responsibilities to the State

The responsibility to regulate the insurance industry is shared by the federal and state governments. However, the states carry the burden of regulating insurance affairs, including the ethical conduct of licensed insurance agents. In some states, the regulation of ethical conduct falls under the category of "marketing practices," while other states refer to it in the context of "unfair trade practices."

Whatever it is called, all states have established a code of ethical standards for insurance agents by defining, through laws and regulations, what an agent can and cannot do. Although these laws differ from state to state, there are enough similarities to discuss them in general terms. This will be the subject of the next section, in which ethical standards for financial planning and the Investment Advisers Act will also be discussed.

#### Ethical Issue Number One

Ethical Issue Number One: Good Intentions Don’t Replace Experience

John and Sue were members of the same agency. John had been with the agency for many years and was experienced in developing employee benefit packages for start-up companies. Linda was new to the insurance business.

John was going out of town to make a service call on one of his cases. While he was packing his briefcase, he noticed that Sue was sitting at her desk, and she appeared to be totally overwhelmed. "What’s wrong?" he asked, noticing Sue’s confusion.

"I’ve made 40 calls this morning--and so far no appointments," she said. "What am I doing wrong?"

John grinned. "Maybe you should have made 50 calls. Tell you what," he said, reaching for his appointment book. "Today’s your lucky day. Al Brewster over at Top-Notch Tools needs to talk to someone about a 401(k) plan for his hourly, salaried, and executive groups. You might try for an appointment."

At their sales appointment, Al Brewester said to sue, "Tell me what kind of tax advantages I can gain if I move my current pension plan over to a 401(k) plan."

Sue remembered a part in the company manual that covered that question. "Mr. Brewester, if you're currently administering a defined benefit pension plan for all your employees, you're paying far too much out of your company treasure for a limited tax break. I can promise you that you will not only be able to cut your annual contribution with a 401(k), but you'll also be able to customize a retirement plan for all three of your employee groups: hourly, salaried, and executive."

Al Brewester was really impressed. "My fiscal year starts in 2 weeks. Can you get something worked up for the accounting department by next Tuesday? If you can, you've got a sale. If you can't, tell me now and I'll go somewhere else."

Sue didn't hesitate. "I will handle this case myself, Mr. Brewester. I specialize in 401(k) plans. What time on Tuesday do you want to meet?" She knew that with the help of the manual, she could get the job done for Al Brewester.

#### Ethical Responsibilities to the Insurer

A potential source of ethical conflict for insurance agents can be a lack of understanding of the contractual relationship that they have with their companies. Understandably, an individual new to the business or one joining a new company will be concerned with the day-to-day matters of insurance sales matters such as quotas, territories, commissions, products, training, support, service, underwriting practices, premium rates, and competition and may have little time to contemplate the other duties and responsibilities that he or she has accepted by signing the agency contract. In this section, we will examine the ethical responsibilities that an agent owes to his or her insurer.

##### The Concept of Agency

The relationship between an insurance agent and his or her company is governed by the concept of agency. **Agency** is a legal term that describes the relationship between two parties, in which one, the principal, has authorized the other, the agent, to perform certain legally binding acts on the principal's behalf. In most agency relationships (including that of an insurance company and its agents), these acts involve making contracts between the principal and outside parties. In carrying out these duties, the agent, in effect, "becomes" the principal and assumes the principal's identity when performing the authorized acts. When an agent acts within the scope of his or her authority, the law takes the position that the actions of the agent are also those of the principal.

##### Power

The essence of an agency relationship is power. Before an individual can act as an agent and establish contracts between the principal and outside parties, he or she must have the power to do so. In the case of an insurer and an agent, this power is granted through an agency contract, which is how an insurer appoints an individual to act on its behalf.

#### Authority

The concept of authority is related to the concept of power. Although the two words are often used interchangeably, their definitions are distinct. The agency contract gives the agent the power to act on behalf of the principal and, at the same time, describes the actions that the agent is authorized to take. Technically, only the authorized acts of an agent can bind a principal; practically and legally, however, an agent's authority can be quite broad.

For example, an agent is given the power to sell and service an insurer's policies, but he or she is authorized to do so only within a certain geographical area. One of the important implications of an agency relationship, and occasionally a source of conflict, is that an agent has the power to take actions that he or she may not be authorized to take.

In essence, there are three types of agency authority: express, implied, and apparent.

##### Expressed Authority

**Express authority** is the authority that a principal intends, actually does, in fact, give to its agents, either orally or in writing. Usually written, express authority spells out the actions that the agent can and cannot perform for the principal. For example, through the agency agreement, a life insurance agent is given the express authority to solicit applications for life insurance and collect the initial premiums for those policies.

##### Implied Authority

**Implied authority** is authority that is not expressly granted--but which the agent is assumed to have in order to transact the business of the principal. It includes those acts that are incidental to the accomplishment of the expressly authorized acts. For instance, when an insurer has expressly authorized an agent to solicit an application and accept premium payments, it also implicitly authorizes the agent to issue a conditional receipt that is binding on the insurer.

##### Apparent Authority

**Apparent authority** is the appearance of--or the assumption of--authority based on the actions, words, or deeds of the principal or because of circumstances that the principal created. In effect, the principal creates the "appearance" of authority. If a third party in good faith relies upon the principal’s intentional or negligent permissiveness in regard to the agent’s acts, the principal will be bound by the acts of the agent because the agent possessed apparent authority.

However, the apparent authority of an agent must be derived from the actions of the principal. For example, if an agent’s agreement with an insurer authorizes him or her to solicit applications only within a specified geographical area, but the company accepts an application and issues a policy outside that area, the apparent authority of the agent to operate outside of that area has been established (or ratified) by the insurer. Statements or actions of an agent alone are not sufficient to create apparent authority.

##### Limitations on Authority

Rarely is an agent's authority to act for a principal unlimited. In most agency relationships, an agent's activity is restricted to some extent. For example, while an insurance agent is authorized to solicit applications, he or she cannot accept or reject a risk. An insurance agent cannot modify a contract or waive exclusions. An insurance agent cannot adjust premium rates. These acts are reserved for the company. Typically, the limits to an agent's authority are spelled out in the agency agreement, and it is within those powers that an agent must act. To step beyond those limits is to invite problems.

### 3. Beyond the Contract

This section will provide a brief overview of the agency concept in order to provide a basis for understanding the contractual relationship that an insurance agent has with his or her company. Obviously, the ethical significance is that an agent must, first and foremost, serve the insurer. The agent must live up to the contract and operate within the scope of his or her authority. But actually, an agent's duty to the insurer goes far beyond the wording of the contract. By entering into this contractual relationship, an agent has also entered into a fiduciary relationship.

#### The Agent as a Fiduciary

A **fiduciary** is an individual whose position and responsibilities involve a high degree of trust and confidence. Trustees, guardians, and executors, by virtue of their responsibilities, are fiduciaries, and so are insurance agents.

An insurer places a great deal of trust and confidence in its agents; consequently, an agent must exercise a corresponding high degree of fairness and good faith, acting in the best interests of the insurer.

Through his or her appointment, an insurance agent is generally given the power and express authority to act for the insurer by:

- Soliciting applications for coverage;
- Describing coverage and policies to prospects and applicants and explaining how the policies can be purchased;
- Collecting premiums (or in some cases, only initial premiums); and
- Providing service to prospects and the insurers policyholders.

Thus, while the provisions of the agency contract tell agents what acts they are authorized to perform, how they go about those tasks is usually left to their own judgment and discretion. But keep in mind that both actions and judgments are held to fiduciary standards.

Serving a fiduciary role demands high ethical standards and performance. In fact, those who depend on fiduciaries exact of them a higher standard of conduct than is required in the usual course of events. For example, assume that a customer at a grocery store is mistakenly given more change than is owed. Ethically, the customer should return the difference - that would be the right thing to do. However, other than the motive or desire to do what is right, there's nothing else compelling the customer to give back the additional money. By comparison, a fiduciary acts in accordance with ethical standards not only because it's the right thing to do, but because he or she must. That is the essence of a fiduciary's role.

So, let's look beyond what an agent is expressly authorized to do and examine the ethics of the fiduciary relationship that he or she has with the insurer.

#### Loyalty to the Insurer

The primary ethical responsibility that an agent owes to the insurer is loyalty. This means that he or she must, at all times, act in the insurers best interest in every matter involving the insurers business. Thus, by extension, an agent cannot act for himself or herself if personal objectives run counter to the insurer's interest.

For instance, while it is common for independent insurance agents and brokers to represent several insurers with the full knowledge and consent of the other insurers, in many agency relationships, unless the agent is specifically authorized to do so, he or she cannot represent competing principals.

An agent is also charged with conforming to the limits of his or her authority and staying within the guidelines of the agency contract.

#### Care and Skill

An agent has a duty to carry out his or her actions with utmost care and skill. As the insurers authorized agent, the agent represents the company to the public and must act accordingly. In some cases, this means that the agent must refer the business to others who are more qualified if the agent is not qualified to handle it.

#### Full Disclosure

An agent is obligated to fully disclose all information that may affect the insurer and its ability to conduct business. Practically speaking, full disclosure is most significant during the application and claims-handling processes. An agent must complete all application and claim forms as accurately as possible. Failure to do so could lead the insurer to follow a course of action that it would not otherwise take (such as issuing a policy to an applicant whose bad health had been concealed).

Therefore, it is the agents or brokers responsibility to see that the answers to questions on the application are recorded fully and accurately. Anything less than full disclosure may prompt the insurer to act in a way that is contrary to its own interest.

#### Prompt Action and Follow-Up

An agent has the obligation to act promptly in all matters regarding the insurers business, but most significant is the responsibility to transmit competed applications and notice of premium receipts as quickly as possible. The insurer cannot begin the process of issuing insurance until it has received an application. Unless the applicant has been given a binding receipt, he or she remains at risk until the policy is issued. On the other hand, if an applicant is given a binding receipt at the time of application, the insurer is obligated to provide coverage, until and unless the applicant is formally rejected. In either event, a delay by the agent in turning over an application or notice of premium receipt may place the applicant or the insurer in jeopardy.

#### Handling of Premiums

Most agents are authorized to collect initial premiums from applicants; some are also allowed to collect renewal premiums. By law, payment to an agent is considered to be payment to the insurer. The agent has the fiduciary duty to account for all funds that he or she receives in connection with the insurers business and to turn these funds over promptly. Even if there is no legal intent, it is unethical to delay or withhold premium payments. In many states, it is illegal to combine premium monies with personal funds. Rarely would it be ethical to do so anyway, regardless of whether a specific law exists.

#### Avoiding Conflicts of Interest

Ethically, an insurance agent who has signed an exclusive contract with his or her insurer cannot serve two principals at the same time. As a "captive" agent, he or she owes a singular loyalty to that insurer. It would be unethical for that agent to represent two insurance companies selling the same policies. In addition, an agent has the ethical obligation to inform his or her company about any other related services that he or she provides and receives payment for. An agent who does part-time preparation and filing, for example, or who serves as a consultant to a local business, should inform his or her company of this activity. The insurer can then determine if there is a conflict of interest.

Independent agents also face this issue when they attempt to serve their clients while being contracted to an insurer. Conflicts can be avoided if independent agents follow these guidelines for dual agency:

- The agent represents the insurance company when insurance is being applied for and when it is in the process of being underwritten, in recordkeeping and in claim settlement or other insurer-related activities.
- The agent "represents" his or her client only during the process of helping the client select the insurance plan best suited to the client's needs.

#### Careful Solicitation

An agent has the ethical duty to protect the insurer's interest by soliciting business that appears to be good and profitable for the insurer. Although at some point every agent will submit an application that is rejected or will write business that quickly lapses, the obligation to exercise reasonable care in soliciting quality business is constant.

At the same time, once an agent has taken an application, he or she has the duty to submit it, even if it appears that the applicant may be a poor or uninsurable risk. Whether or not an individual is issued coverage is a decision for the insurer's underwriters.

#### Competitive Integrity

The insurance industry is highly competitive. For an agent, there exists ample opportunity to conduct business inappropriately at the expense of a competitor. Misrepresentation or defamation of a competitor casts a dark reflection on the entire industry. As a duty to his or her insurer and to the industry itself, an agent must resist this temptation. Ethics requires that an agent acknowledge the worth of other agents and their policies and compete only on the basis of the value of the products and service that he or she can provide.

#### Duties of the Principal to the Agent

The relationship between the agent and the principal is a two-way street. The principal also owes certain duties to the agent. A rule of agency law is that the principal is responsible for all of the agent's acts when he or she is acting within the scope of his or her authority. This responsibility includes fraudulent acts, omissions, and misrepresentations.

The principal, then, must carefully select honest, loyal, and hard-working agents to protect itself from potential liability. In return, the principal gives the agent:

- Compensation, or payment, for the business that the agent has given to the principal;
- Employment (The principal must specify a reasonable period of time during which the agent is expected to produce a certain amount of business.); and
- Indemnity. The principal is obligated to reimburse the agent for any damages or expenses incurred in defending against claims that the agent may be held liable for in the course of fulfilling his or her agency obligations.

#### Who is an Agent of the Insurer?

Up to now, this course has focused on the relationship between the insurer and the insurance agent. The preceding explanation of legal and ethical principles has been based on the assumption that the agent works singularly for one insurer.

But what is the relationship of a broker to an insurer? How do these principles apply to those who represent more than one insurer? Let's take a look.

##### Is a Broker an Agent?

An **insurance broker** is one who places business with more than one company and has no exclusive contract requiring that his or her business first be offered to a single company. Legally, a broker obtains insurance for anyone who requests him or her to do so and represents the customer. For this reason, the insurance broker is an agent of the applicant. "Broker" and "brokerage" are not interchangeable terms. In insurance, **brokerage** is often used to describe business placed by persons who are not regular members of the insurers agency force.

A full-time career agent of one insurer may also have a broker's license and submit occasional applications to another insurer. This can happen when coverage is available through the second insurer that is not offered by the first.

Any life insurance agent may represent the insurer for some purposes and the applicant for others. This occurs frequently in the brokerage business.

There is an exception to the general rule that an insurance broker represents the client. This occurs when an insurer gives a policy to a broker for delivery to an insured. During the delivery process, the broker becomes the agent of the insurer. Should collection of premium be involved, payment to the broker would be considered as payment to the insurance company.

#### A Broker’s Responsibilities to the Insurer

The insurance broker represents the buyer of insurance in most parts of the insurance transaction and, therefore, owes all of the duties of an agency relationship to the client. However, even though a broker technically represents the clients, the ethical and fiduciary standards that apply to an agent also apply to a broker.

For example, a broker has the duty to fully disclose all information that he or she has regarding an application for insurance. A broker is charged with carrying out his or her actions with utmost skill and care. A broker should seek quality business and provide prompt, exacting service. A broker must complete fairly and ethically, relying on his or her abilities, and not operate at the expense of other agents.

Actually, it makes little difference whether an individual represents one insurer or works with a number of insurers; the ethics and fiduciary standards are virtually identical.

### 4. Ethical Responsibilities to Policyowners

Some people believe that an insurance agent's greatest single obligation is to his or her policyowners. Yet, if you are an agent of the insurer, how can this be? How can an insurance sales representative serve the best interests of both the insurer and policyowner? The answer lies in knowing that these interests are not really in conflict. By promoting the concepts that insurers stand for and by selling the appropriate products in the appropriate situations, in a competent, professional manner, the agent meets the needs of both the insurer and the insured. In this section, we discuss how agents can fulfill their ethical responsibilities to policyowners through needs selling and quality service.

#### Selling to Needs

Before an individual becomes a policyowner, he or she is a prospect. The transition from prospect to policyowner—and ultimately from policyowner to client—comes about when an agent follows two basic rules:

1. Sell to needs.
2. Service the sale.

In doing so, the agent will also live up to the ethical duties that he or she has to policyowners.

An insurance agent has one principal reason for calling on a prospect: to offer a product or service that will benefit the prospect in some way. An agent must sell the kinds of policies that will best fit the prospect’s needs and in amounts that he or she can afford to pay. No one profits—not the insurer, not the agent, and especially not the policyowner—if an individual is coerced or misled into buying too much insurance or purchasing coverage that doesn’t suit specific needs.

Fortunately, most agents recognize that selling to fit needs is the best approach to the products and services that they represent. They know that specific types of insurance policies are designed to meet specific needs and that matching policies to needs produces the maximum effect, to the benefit of the policyowner. They also know that needs selling involves problem analysis, action planning, product recommendation, and plan implementation. This requires two important commitments on the agent's part:

1. A commitment to obtain and maintain the knowledge and skills necessary to carry out those tasks; and
2. A commitment to educating the prospect or client about the products and plans that may be implemented.

#### Commitment to Knowledge and Skills

The relationship between the professional insurance agent and the policyowner is usually built upon the policyowner’s trust in the agent’s knowledge and skills. The policyowner must rely on the agent to provide informed options and trusts that the recommendations for insurance are in the client’s best interest.

An agent thus has an obligation to ensure that this trust is justified. This means that an agent has the ethical responsibility to obtain the necessary knowledge and skills needed to evaluate and service the insurance needs of clients. Indeed, the term "professional" implies knowledge and skill. If the agent feels that he or she is not properly trained to perform the needed service, then another professional should be called in to assist.

An agent must also keep his or her base of knowledge and skills current. To this end, the agent must be committed to a program of continuing education. He or she must also stay informed of the latest developments affecting a client’s interests. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend toward insurance professionalism. Agents should be competent professionals with a high degree of technical knowledge so that they can match a prospect’s need with the appropriate solution.

#### Commitment to Educating the Prospect or Client

Client trust must be earned, nurtured, and constantly reinforced. The agent who remembers this basic rule is the agent who communicates to his or her client the reasons why a particular insurance policy or program is being recommended and how it will serve the client.

Individuals who understand what a particular insurance plan or policy will do for them are more likely to buy, more likely to be satisfied with their insurance, and more likely to keep their business on the books. This communication and education continues long after the particular policy or program is sold and becomes part of the overall insurance program designed for that client. As noted earlier, the professional agent has established his or her client’s insurance program based on needs. These needs should be reviewed annually, supported by explanation and communication of the programs put in place to meet those needs.

#### Service the Sale

Selling to needs is only part of what an agent must do to meet the ethical responsibilities that he or she owes to a policyholder. Service during and after the sale is just as important. Quality and productivity experts such as W. Edwards Deming and Joseph M. Juran see service as a process in which the customer's wants and needs are anticipated and then satisfied. Most companies today are committed to giving their customers quality service.

In fact, the quality of a company's level of service is perceived as the most important single factor affecting a business unit's performance in the long run. Since 1972, the Strategic Planning Institute (SPI) of Cambridge, Massachusetts, has collected data to determine what corporate strategies influence performance. SPIs studies consistently show that successful companies stress quality service over their competitors.

#### What Role Does Ethics Play When it Comes to Service?

Perhaps one of the most important aspects of business ethics is that the characteristics one associates with an ethical person such as fairness, honesty, and personal responsiveness, affects the level of service that a company provides. For example, an insurance agent who doesn't promptly return a client's telephone calls or procrastinates in giving a client important information about a policy will only hurt his or her reputation as a responsible professional. Therefore, treating clients with ethical principles will result in a high level of quality service.

Keep in mind that the term "service" means many things, and no two people would define all that it entails in precisely the same manner. However, for the purpose of this discussion, we will cover the elements of service in the context of ethical selling and professional responsibility. Thus, we will define "service" to mean:

- Educating the client before, during, and after the sale.
- Ensuring that the client fully understands the application and underwriting processes, the policy purchased, and any attached riders;
- Treating with confidentially the clients financial and personal affairs;
- Disclosing all information needed by the policyholder or applicant so that he or she can make an informed decision; and
- Showing loyalty to the client, which includes providing the full range of services offered by the insurer.

##### Service Begins with the Application

In securing coverage for your client, your main responsibility as an agent is to act reasonably under the circumstances. This means that you must also adhere to your ethical responsibilities to the insurer and see that the prospect completes the application accurately and completely.

At this point, your primary responsibility is to the insurer because you are acting as its agent during the application process. Remember that the insurer is relying upon you for full disclosure of all pertinent information regarding the applicant. However, you also have an ethical responsibility to educate your prospective insured to make sure that he or she fully understands the nature of the application process:

- Why the information is required;
- How it will be evaluated;
- The need for accuracy and honesty in answering all questions; and
- The meaning of terms such as "waiver of premium", "automatic premium loan", "nonforfeiture options", and "conditional receipt."

##### The Conditional Receipt

Because the conditional receipt is occasionally a source of misunderstanding with applicants, let’s clarify what is and how insurance agents should explain it.

A conditional receipt is normally given when the applicant pays the initial premium at the time the application for a policy is signed. This means that the applicant and the company have formed what might be called a "conditional contract," one contingent upon conditions that existed at the time of application or when a later medical examination is completed. In other words, a conditional receipt provides that the applicant is covered immediately from the date of application, as long as he or she passes the insurer’s underwriting requirements. If a medical examination or blood profile is subsequently required, the date of coverage begins once the applicant passes the medical examination.

This information regarding the conditional receipt should be made clear to the applicant. Many applicants accustomed to homeowners or automobile insurance—where coverage is available immediately upon issuance of the binding receipt—assume that their life insurance coverage is also effective upon submitting the application and premium. It is your ethical responsibility to explain that the applicant is covered on the condition that he or she proves to be insurable and passes the medical exam, if required.

##### Explaining the Underwriting Process

Another ethical responsibility that you owe your applicant is to briefly explain the underwriting process that the application will undergo. Although many insurance policies are issued on the basis of the application alone, others require additional information. No prospect should ever be surprised that he or she could be subjected to further underwriting. Therefore, the explanation of the underwriting process should include a description of the checks and balances that apply to underwriting a risk, such as the Medical Information Bureau, the inspection report, and the credit report

###### The Medical Information Bureau (MIB)

The **Medical Information Bureau (MIB**) serves as a clearinghouse of medical information concerning applicants and helps to disclose cases where an applicant conceals or submits misleading medical information. A life underwriter can check the MIB for information on an applicant's past medical history. This possibility should be explained to your applicant when you ask for a signature on the MIB form.

###### The Inspection Report

An **inspection report** provides details on an applicant's lifestyle, finances, and exposure to abnormal hazards. An inspection report is usually ordered on applicants who apply for large amounts of insurance. It's conceivable that the prospects friends and/or employer may be contacted for purposes of an inspection report. The purpose of this report is to provide a picture of an applicant's general character and mode of living.

###### The Credit Report

A **credit report** is ordered when there is reason to question the applicant's ability to pay the premiums and to determine whether he or she may be a poor credit risk. Applicants who have questionable credit ratings can cause an insurance company to lose money. Applicants with poor credit standing are likely to allow their policies to lapse within a short time, perhaps even before a second premium is paid. Again, the purpose of this report should be explained when you ask the applicant to sign the authorization form.

##### The Importance of the Application to the Applicant

All of the information submitted on an insurance application has a direct bearing on whether the policy will be issued as requested, whether the application will be rejected, or whether another policy will be offered by the insurer. An agent who knowingly or unknowingly fails to provide all the necessary information about a prospect is not serving anyone's best interest.

Consider, for example, that you visit a prospective client in his home. You ask if he has any dangerous hobbies, and he says that his most dangerous activity is serving as an armchair quarterback for his favorite football team. As your client is filling out the application, you notice a picture on the wall of your client with a group of several other people on a mountain hiking expedition. When you mention this, your client remarks that as a hobby, he is a mountain climber and leads people on tours up Mount Everest. This is definitely more dangerous than serving as an armchair quarterback.

Because you are afraid that your client will not be issued an affordable policy if this detail is mentioned, you advise him to omit it from the application. The policy is later issued, and all is well.

But, what happens if, a year later, the insured is killed in a mountain-climbing accident? It's quite likely that the insurer will contest or deny the claim, citing concealment. Rather than getting the policy proceeds, the family receives a return of premiums paid. What benefit did this policy provide? What kind of service did you render?

This example illustrates why precision and accuracy in completing the application are in the best interest of both the insurer and the prospective insured. It is vital that an agent understands this and explains the need for full disclosure to an applicant.

##### Confidentiality

In the course of qualifying a prospect, completing a financial questionnaire, analyzing needs, or working on an estate or business plan, insurance agents are privy to a client's personal and financial information. Ethics require that the agent respect the sensitive nature of this information and keep it confidential. Personal information about a client should never be released without proper approval from the client.

### 5. Full Disclosure to the Applicant

As has been emphasized throughout the text, insurance agents have a duty to fully disclose to the insurer all material facts concerning an applicant, policyowner, or situations involving both, to aid in any decision that the insurer has to make regarding a particular case. At the same time, an agent has the ethical responsibility of full disclosure to a prospect or client.

In this context, full disclosure means informing the prospect or client of all facts involving a specific policy or plan, so an informed decision can be made. Full disclosure allows the insurance agent to help the client:

- Select the most appropriate policy to meet his or her needs;
- Understand the basic features of life insurance; and
- Evaluate the relative costs of similar plans offered by a competitor.

To assist agents with disclosure, there are published documents available to help the consumer understand the intricacies of a life insurance policy. Many agents use the forms not only as an educational tool, but also to help them in their sales presentations. These forms include the NAIC Buyer's Guide and Policy Summary.

#### The NAIC Buyer’s Guide

The Buyer's Guide was developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as an aid to consumers who are contemplating the purchase of life insurance. Most states require that agents make the Buyer's Guide (or similar document) available when they solicit insurance sales. This guide explains life insurance in a way that the average consumer can understand. It speaks of the concept in general and does not address the specific product or policy being considered. Included in the Buyer's Guide is an explanation of the surrender cost indexes used in the Policy Summary.

#### The Policy Summary

The Policy Summary includes two types of cost indexes:

1. The life insurance surrender cost index; and
2. The life insurance net payment cost index.

The surrender cost index is useful to applicants who want to compares the death benefits of policies.

The Buyer’s Guide and Policy Summary are especially helpful to agents who want to explain the features and benefits of the life insurance policy that they are presenting. These forms also provided needed guidelines for the comparison of two or more policies.

#### Keeping the Applicant Informed

The underwriting process for an insurance application can be time-consuming. Most insurance companies strive to complete the process within a 21-day period, assuming that there are no delays. Delays can occur whenever an underwriter needs additional information from the applicant and relays that request through the agent, or when a counteroffer, different policy, or different rate is made to the applicant (again through the agent).

An agent's ethical responsibilities to his or her client during the underwriting process center around promptness and policy delivery.

##### Promptness

An insurance agent needs to ensure that there are no unnecessary delays in the underwriting process. Thus does not mean that the agent has to rush from an applicant's home to the nearest post office to mail an application. It does mean, however, checking the application for accuracy and giving careful thought to it before the application is actually submitted. Many underwriting delays occur simply because the application is not complete or is not clear.

Applications should be submitted as soon as possible. The time frame will vary, of course, depending on the plan of insurance and the complexity of the case. An agent must take these factors into account to act in an efficient manner. If it appears that the underwriting process may take longer than anticipated, the agent should notify the applicant of the delay.

##### Policy Delivery

Most policies are issued as applied for. In such cases, the agent owes his or her new policyowner prompt delivery of the policy and a review of its features and benefits. Not only does this help solidify the sale, it also represents a step toward making the policyowner a lasting client.

On the other hand, some policies will be rated or rejected. When this happens, the agent has two responsibilities:

1. He or she personally reviews the rating or rejection. Was it medical? Was there an unfavorable medical report? Was something overlooked or not made known to the underwriter? Should additional information be submitted? Is the rating or rejection proper? Should the application be reconsidered? In any event, the agent should have as much information as possible and be able to explain the rating or rejection to the applicant.
2. Assuming that the rating or rejection was valid, the agent has the responsibility to notify the applicant promptly. To withhold this information is a breach of ethics and could actually harm the applicant and his or her family.

##### Special Situations

In most cases, an insurance agent needs only common sense to avoid an unethical situation with a policyholder. However, there are some specialized areas where the agent's ethical conduct is specifically detailed.

These specific ethical responsibilities are spelled out for agents active in estate and professional business planning. In these areas, the ethical guidelines are clearly defined by professional organizations chartered to monitor the activities of their practitioners.

#### Estate or Business Planning Insurance

An insurance agent who works in estate or business planning knows that the valuable plans and programs that he or she helps implement for a client are often the result of a joint effort with other professionals, such as attorneys and accountants. Typically, an insurance agent is the catalyst who, through analysis and planning, evaluates the client's needs, proposes a solution, and then brings together the professional estate or business planning team.

Unfortunately, the zealous activities of some agents have triggered serious disagreements with members of the legal profession. The American Bar Association has issued opinions regarding the ethical conduct of insurance agents and their advertising and sales presentations to prospects and clients in these areas.

The following is a summary of the American Bar Association's position regarding the legal role of an insurance agent:

> Persons who are not lawyers can be active in areas of analysis of facts, the orderly arrangement of assets to provide for a client's needs while living, and for the economic needs of dependents after the clients death. Persons who are not lawyers may also provide general information as to the laws governing the disposition of these assets.
> 
> Persons who are not lawyers but who do legal research, give specific legal advice, draft legal documents, or apply legal principles to a client's specific situation are engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.
> 
> A producer should never dissuade a client from seeking the advice of legal counsel. It is improper for a producer to attempt to divert legal business from one attorney to another.
> 
> A producer must never share or participate in an attorney's fee. A producer must not pay directly or indirectly any part of his or her commission to an attorney or any other person who is not a producer.

The professional insurance agent understands that each member of the estate or business planning team serves a specific function. The attorney drafts the documents necessary to accomplish the client's objectives and advises the client of any legal consequences, while the accountant determines the accounting and tax implications and procedures. On the other hand, the agent recommends specific insurance policies or plans in an appropriate amount and ensures that ownership and beneficiary designations conform to the legal agreements prepared by the attorney.

The insurance agent understands that his or her ability to help meet the client's objectives depends on the involvement of these other professionals and encourages their participation.

Once the policy is issued and an applicant becomes a policyowner and client, service becomes more than ethical responsibility; service now forms the foundation in which the agent and client form a lasting relationship. All policyowners should receive periodic reviews to ensure that their insurance programs are in step with their plans and objectives. Service after the sale is more than a responsibility; it is part of a life insurance industry tradition. Agents through the years have helped build that tradition, and your future success as an agent depends on your continuing that tradition.

#### Ethical Responsibilities to the Public

The insurance professional has a great degree of control over the public's attitude toward insurance. This is because the agent initiates contact with a prospect, determines a prospects need for insurance, recommends and implements an appropriate plan, and continues a long-term relationship with after-sale service.

Because the agent has significant contact with the public and represents a primary source of insurance information, public perceptions of the insurance industry can be severely damaged by unethical agents. The professional insurance agent has two ethical responsibilities to the public:

1. To inform the public about insurance with the highest level of professional integrity; and
2. To strive for an equally high level of professionalism in all public contacts to create and maintain a strong positive image of the industry.

##### Public Obligation

Insurance plays a major role in the lives of most people in the United States. Property insurance protects homes and businesses from losses resulting from fire and natural disasters. Liability coverage protects individuals from losses resulting from accidents. Medical insurance not only provides a cushion against economic disaster, but in many instances it also helps to speed recovery because the patient does not have to worry about paying the bills. Lastly, life insurance benefits and cash values represent a substantial part of the financial holding and retirement plans of many people.

Considering how important insurance is and how it benefits our lives, it's surprising how many people just do not understand even the fundamentals of insurance. Given that some consumers remain ignorant about insurance, it's possible for unscrupulous agents to take advantage of these people by inducing them to buy policies that are unnecessary or do not live up to the promised benefits.

Many consumers feel that insurance is one area in which a wrong purchase is easy to make. The terminology is confusing, and the conditions and exclusions seem complicated. Further, it may not always appear that the agent is working in the consumer's best interest.

To combat this perception, the professional insurance agent must offer the public an honest and fair explanation of the policies and services that he or she represents. In addition, the insurance agent has to be dedicated to the principle of needs selling.

This means that the agent must clearly explain policy features and benefits without misleading the consumer or misrepresenting the policy and its benefits. And the professional insurance agent must be ready to back up his or her promises with solid performance, and encourage other agents to do the same.

### 6. A View from the Top

In 1990, the Ethics Resource Center conducted a survey of key ethical issues in the American insurance industry. Participating in the survey were the chief executive officers of top property-casualty companies (in terms of premiums written) and the top life insurance companies (in terms of insurance issued). Each CEO was asked to rate the key ethical issues facing their particular industry. In this "view from the top," these executives indicated that two of the most significant ethics problems are deceptive use of advertising material and deceptive sales presentations, both of which do great damage to the public's perception of the insurance industry.

#### Deceptive Use of Advertising Material

There are two indisputable facts about insurance and the buying public:

1. The average insurance buyer knows very little about insurance and relies on the advice and recommendations of the insurance agent; and
2. By the time a consumer finds that a particular policy does not meet his or her needs or does not live up to the agent’s promises, it may be too late to purchase another policy.

The potential for deceptive advertising or promotion by companies and agents alike is significant, and the consequences to the consumer can be quite grave. Accordingly, all states have enacted laws regulating insurance advertising. The basis for many of these state statutes is the NAIC’s model Unfair Trade Practices Act, which expressly cites false advertising as an unfair trade practice and prohibits it. In this context, the term "advertising" is quite broad. It includes print and radio material, descriptive literature, sales aids, slide shows, prepared group talks, brochures, sales illustrations, policy illustrations, and TV commercials—in short, almost any kind of communication or presentation used to promote the sale of an insurance policy.

The purpose of the NAIC model act is to established guidelines to ensure that insurance companies and their agents promote their products properly and accurately, without exaggerating the benefits or minimizing the drawbacks. For example, the act forbids any misrepresentations of the benefits, terms, conditions, or features of any insurance policy, including dividends. The act also bars any misrepresentation of an insurer's financial condition or its legal reserve system, and it prohibits names or titles of insurance that do not represent their true character.

Some states have enacted regulations that separately address life insurance and health insurance advertising. Life insurance advertising, for instance, cannot use the terms "investment", "savings", or "profit" in a misleading way. Health insurance advertising must disclose provisions regarding renewability, cancellability, termination, or modification of benefits.

Generally speaking, the burden of complying with state insurance advertising law rests on insurance companies because most advertisements or promotional pieces, regardless of the writer or presenter, are considered to be the responsibility of the insurer whose policies are being advertised. In practice, most of the advertising and sales literature that an agent uses is prepared by the insurer under the careful eye of its legal staff. For an agent, then, the ethical issue isn't necessarily the material itself, but instead how the material is used, and the deceptive sales presentation that may result.

#### Deceptive Sales Presentations

Deceptive sales presentations have probably generated more complaints of unethical agent behavior than any other activity. In addition to the life insurance CEOs in the United States, concern over this activity is shared by the National Association of Life Underwriters (NALU) and the American Society of CLU & ChFC, as well as by the Independent Insurance Agents of America. The topic has also been addressed by the U.S. Congress in committees studying insurance company activity.

What constitutes a deceptive sale? Any presentation that gives a prospect or client the wrong impression about any aspect of an insurance policy or plan is deceptive. Any presentation that does not provide complete disclosure to a prospect or client is deceptive. Any presentation that includes misleading or inconclusive product comparisons is deceptive. Even if the deception is unintentional, the agent has done the consumer a great disservice.

Deceptive sales presentations can be blatant. For example, a comparison of a term policy and a whole life policy based only on premium rates is obviously misleading and incomplete. Yet, deception does not have to be so apparent to be unethical. What about describing a personal life insurance policy as a "tax shelter" but failing to mention that premiums are not deductible and that surrendered cash values may be subject to tax? What about recommending a certain kind of health policy without explaining the conditions under which it could be canceled or the premiums increased? While any of these ploys might help make the sale, they are all misleading and unethical.

#### Policy Illustrations

Of all the companies surrounding the marketing and the sales of life insurance, none resonate so loudly as those over the use and misuse of policy illustrations. As insurance policies changed over the years, with the emphasis on the growth, return, and investment aspects of permanent plans; the "unbundling" of a policy's accumulation and protection elements; and the flexibility of premium payments, insurers and agents discovered that one of the best ways to demonstrate the complex mechanics of a policy was through the use of the computerized policy illustration.

Unfortunately, these illustrations have also been used to "predict" a policy's potential and its future performance based on assumptions that may or may not be realized. Vanishing premiums, huge cash values, in-force lifetime benefits -- all of these things have been extolled to sell a life insurance policy, without the explanation that they are based on nonguaranteed numbers projected into the future. What did not accompany these illustrations was an understanding on the part of the consumer that the values they were being shown would materialize only if the underlying assumptions came true.

Along with the changing dimensions and features of today's life insurance products comes a subtle shift in risk back to the buyer. The more flexible the policy, the more aggressive the assumptions and the more sensitive the product will be to changes in mortality, expense, and interest rates. However, this fact has been buried, ignored, or glossed over, intentionally and unintentionally, in too many sales presentations. Current and illustrative values have been spotlighted, and guaranteed values have been pushed backstage. In many sales situations, the policy illustration became the focus of the presentation (i.e., the illustration became the product).

The consequences of illustration-based selling became apparent in the early 1990s. Individuals who purchased life insurance policies in the mid-1980s (when interest rates were high) with the expectation that they would pay premiums for only seven or eight years found out that their policy's accumulated values were sufficient to "vanish" but were charged against the policy's value. Others who bought plans with the idea that premiums of a few hundred dollars a year would produce values of a million dollars by the time they were ready to retire discovered that they were far from their goals.

The experiences described above gave momentum to the charge that the misuse of policy illustrations has created a "crisis" situation in the insurance industry. Consumer groups, politicians, and journalists have declared that life insurance buyers are being misled by many in the insurance industry who abuse the use of policy illustrations and don't distinguish between values and benefits that are guaranteed and those that are not. For some agents and some companies, the allegations have led to lawsuits.

The problems associated with policy illustrations have compelled the industry to respond. Insurance companies are redesigning their disclosures to promote better understanding by consumers as to policy pricing, company and product performance, and illustration assumptions. They're instructing their agents to show illustrations based on a variety of assumptions, not merely those in which current assumptions prevail against the guarantees. However, perhaps the most significant initiatives, given their combined impact and reach, come from the NAIC and the American Society of CLU & ChFC. The NAIC has draft model legislation on policy illustrations, and the American Society has developed an illustration questionnaire to help agents understand the assumption that is used to designed and create sales illustrations.

### 7. The Role of Ethics

The term "professional status" implies long-term success, and with good reason. The qualities that make you a professional will also make you successful in your career over the long run.

The following are qualities of a successful professional:

- Performance of an essential service to society;
- Command of specialized knowledge;
- Possession of a tolerant attitude toward competition; and
- Adherence to high ethical standards.

Let’s look at each of these qualities.

#### Essential Service

Our society depends on insurance increasingly as a means of protection from financial disaster. Life insurance purchases continue to increase each year. There is a growing concern over health insurance coverage. Property insurance coverage forms part of every mortgage contract, lease agreement, and is often found in construction, service, and maintenance agreements. In some cases, Casualty coverages, such as auto liability and workers compensation, are required by law.

Insurance is an essential service in our society, and insurance professionals are instrumental in causing one or more of the following to happen, now or at some point in the future:

1. A policyholder dies, and his or her survivors are able to remain financially comfortable in their own home because life insurance provided the funds that were needed for both mortgage liquidation and living expenses.
2. A couple enjoys a worry-free retirement because a fund begun years before by a timely life insurance policy or annuity made the money available at the right time.
3. A young person is able to attend college or vocational school because someone made the timely purchase of a policy designed to provide the necessary funding in the event of the premature death of the family provider.
4. The physical assets of a business are destroyed by fire or other peril but are quickly replaced, and people are soon put back to work earning their incomes because insurance against the occurrence of the event had been secured.
5. The financial ruin of a policyowner following an automobile accident for which he or she may have had some legal responsibility is averted because he or she had adequate insurance to cover such occurrences.

#### Specialized Knowledge

The insurance professional must have a thorough understanding of how the product works and how it meets the needs of the public. Agents must be able to analyze needs and recommend proper solutions. They must also be able to motivate people to take action. Home office personnel need to know how companies operate and how to provide necessary support to agents, policyowners, and management. Claims representatives need to understand the obligations of the parties to the insurance contract, as well as how to deal with people.

#### Tolerant Attitude Toward Competition

Agents should avoid criticizing other agents; such activity is detrimental to everyone in the business. Any criticism of other companies' policies should be avoided. An incomplete comparison is misleading and harmful to the public, and it can even result in the revocation of the license of the guilty party.

If you are asked to evaluate an insurance company's reputation, you should refer your questioners to one of the widely-respected insurance company rating systems. These evaluate each insurance company's financial status and look at reserves, underwriting, investments, and management, and rate the companies accordingly. Some of the most widely known and respected are AM Best Company, Standards and Poor's, and Weiss Rating, Inc.

In addition, some situations, such as the handling of death claims or a national disaster, call for insurance professionals to lay aside all thoughts of competition and join hands to provide the best possible service for the people involved.

#### High Ethical Standards

The most distinguishing characteristic of a professional is an adherence to high ethical standards. There are minimum legal standards that must be complied with in order to engage in the insurance business. However, professionalism implies more than just meeting these minimum standards. To be a professional, you must put your client's interest ahead of your own. Taking ethical shortcuts will impair not only your status as a professional but also your long-term success. In perhaps no other industry is the element of trust more important than in the insurance business. In the Journal of Insurance Regulation, "Ethics and Compliance in the Business of Life Industry: Reflections of an Ethicists," author Ronald Duska has this to say:

Massive changes in the insurance industry are encouraging enlightened leaders, particularly those in the compliance field, to become more ethically attuned to the needs of clients, agents, and other stakeholders. Compliance officers need to convey that their office does more than worry about the law, but rather is seen as driven by the overriding ethical concern for the good of the customer. An ethical perspective must overlay the compliance perspective, addressing three basic rules: fulfilling ones responsibilities, being fair, and doing no unnecessary harm. Attitudes reflected in the statements "If it's legal, it's moral" and "You can't legislate morality" mitigate against this goal, and reflect outmoded ways of thinking. To advance the theme that "Good ethics is good business," compliance officers can use reward systems, behavioral controls (external force), and ethical attitudes, reflected in the Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."

People like to do business with people you trust. Trust is built by ethical behavior. When people find a business person who has high ethical behavior, when people find a business person who has high ethical standards, they tend to do more business with that person. On the other hand, when they observe a business person acting unethically, they'll be reluctant to do more business with that person.

#### How to Incorporate Ethical Values in Life

While properly defining professionalism requires accuracy, everyone agrees that a high ethical standard is an integral part of the definition. What is required in order to live a more ethical life and develop a more ethically-based career?

Experts agree there are three fundamental elements:

1. Commitment: The desire to do the right thing;
2. Sensitivity: An awareness of the ethical implications of situations that you face; and
3. Ethical Competency: Applying a decision-making process that has ethical principles as its foundation.

While some people are committed to doing the right thing, others are committed to maximizing their income, increasing their pleasure, or avoiding difficult situations. There is often a price to pay for doing the right thing, especially in the short term. Leading an ethical lifestyle requires a strong commitment to doing the right thing

Every day, most of us walk past opportunities to improve the quality of our own lives and those of others with whom we come in contact. We often respond to situations automatically, the way we always have, or the way we see others respond. We fail to recognize the opportunities to "take the high road."

We all need help in leading a more ethical life. If we are to build a quality life, we need some guidelines and practice in doing the right thing. That said, rules of thumb are not enough in a difficult ethical dilemma.

#### Major Themes in Ethical Philosophy

Philosophers consider ethics to be the science of conduct, the fundamental ground rules by which all people live their lives. Philosophers have been discussing ethics for at least 2,500 years, since the time of Socrates and Plato. Many ethicists consider emerging ethical beliefs to be state-of-the-art legal matters. What becomes an ethical guideline today is often translated into a law, regulation, or rule tomorrow.

The following major themes run through all ethical philosophies. By reviewing these four themes, we soon realize that there may be another perspective to any position.

1. Concern for Self vs. Concern for Others
2. Intuition vs. Rationalism
3. Religious Teaching vs. Individual Authority
4. Absolutism vs. Relativism

Because people have different belief systems, none of us is in the position to judge another's motives. Some people take others into consideration when making decisions, believing that the decision should reflect the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Other people make their decisions based purely on their own happiness, welfare, or enjoyment. Their philosophy is "You take care of yourself, and I will take care of myself."

Some people adhere to religious doctrines that present what is right and what is wrong. They reference holy writings, revelations, or tradition to establish good behavior. According to that religion, each person should attempt to follow those traditions. Other thinkers, like Jean Paul Sartre (1905-1980), believe that there are no absolute values, that each person creates his or her own values and projects them onto the world.

Some people believe that certain actions are always right or good, without exception. Other people hold that "goodness" or "rightness" of actions depends on the circumstances.

#### The Challenges in Ethics

Sometimes, taking the most ethical path means that you will lose something else that is important to you. If we are to live an ethically based life, we must be willing to lose for the right reasons. The probability of losing is a test of your ethical courage. The willingness to lose for the right reasons is the price you pay factor (PTP Factor) for leading an ethically based life. People in positions of power, motivated to "win at all costs," often have great difficulty with this challenge.

There is often a price to pay for leading a more ethically based life; fortunately, in the long run, the rewards are also greater.

#### Is a Code of Ethics Effective?

Many people believe that codes of ethics, or lists of ethical values to which the organization aspires, are rather superfluous because they represent values to which everyone should naturally aspire. However, the value of a code of ethics to an organization is its priority and focus regarding certain ethical values in that workplace.

For example, it is obvious that it is desirable for all people to be honest. However, if an organization is struggling around continuing occasions of deceit in its industry, placing a priority on honesty is very timely, and honesty should be listed in that organizations code of ethics.

A code of ethics is an organic instrument, so it often changes with the needs of society and the organization.

### 8. Ethics vs. Values

Ethics is the rightness of what you do.

Values are what you believe in—what you hold important.

Values that represent how an individual should behave are considered to be moral values, such as respect, honesty, fairness, and responsibility. Statements around how these values are applied are sometimes called moral or ethical principles.

Many people do not realize the connection between values and ethics. They live each day without recognizing the cumulative impact of their individual actions. Leading an ethical life requires that we establish our values carefully and then work every day to live up to those values.

#### Core Ethical Principles

We build more a principled life with the small choices that we make each day. If we are to lead more ethically-based lives, we must all develop the ability to recognize ethical considerations. We must all become better at recognizing these opportunities to elevate our existence.

These core ethical values can serve as a tool to identify ethical considerations. Whenever honesty, integrity, promise-keeping, fidelity, loyalty, fairness, caring, compassion, respect for others, and personal responsibility come into play, it always involves the consideration of ethics.

Ethical decision-making is a process of evaluating and choosing among alternatives. The goal is to eliminate unethical options and select the best ethical alternative. To consistently make ethical decisions, one must accomplish two fundamental things:

1. Evaluate alternative courses of conduct on the basis of core ethical principles; and
2. Choose the action that best advances those principles.

There are many definitions of ethics, but it is generally accepted that any definition would include the following core ethical values, and the long-term commitment to their implementation:

1. **Honesty:** Is truthful, straightforward, sincere, and candid. It is not deceptive, tricky, or misleading.
2. **Integrity:** Is honorable. It has courage of conviction; it stands up for beliefs and puts principle over expediency. It is not hypocritical, weak, or dishonorable.
3. **Promise-keeping:** Always strives to keep commitments.
4. **Fidelity/Loyalty:** Commits to being reliable and dependable.
5. **Fairness:** Strives to be equitable, open, just, and unprejudiced. It does not discriminate on an improper basis. It is not arbitrary or self-serving.
6. **Caring/Compassion:** Is considerate, kind, sharing, and charitable. It is not selfish, manipulative, or controlling.
7. **Respects for Others:** Respects freedom, dignity, and rights of others.
8. **Personal Responsibility:** Considers consequences and accepts responsibility for actions and inaction. It doesn't shift blame or make excuses.

#### Rationalization as a Tool

There are a variety of reasons why we do not take the actions necessary to earn the high ethical ratings that we give ourselves. To make ourselves more comfortable with our actions, we often revert to rationalizations. Have you ever heard yourself say any of the following?

1. "I'm simply fighting fire with fire."
2. "If it is legal, it must be okay."
3. "I was just doing it for you."
4. "We all do it; it's just how you play the game."
5. "If it doesn't hurt anyone, it's okay."
6. "It's necessary to get the order."
7. "Business is business. I'll be as ethical as the competition allows."
8. "I deserve it: I have it coming."

Rationalizations make it easier to live with ourselves when we do the things that we want to do, rather than the things that we know we should be doing.

#### The Bottom Line

History is made and lives are changed not by those who follow the crowd, but by those who are prepared to take the ultimate risk and stand up for what is right.

It is always a challenge to do the right thing in a competitive environment. But each time we make a decision to stand for what is right, even if it costs us something, we reinforce our own moral character and influence others.

We do not develop that ability overnight. It is developed in small steps as we do the right thing each day. Unfortunately, many of us do not even recognize the opportunities that exist.

There are four basic principles of a highly ethical individual:

1. The individual is at ease when interacting with diverse customers.
2. The individual is obsessed with fairness. The individual's ground rules emphasize that the other persons interests count as much as his/her own.
3. The individual assumes personal responsibility for his/her actions, and he/she is responsible for himself/herself first and then to his/her organization.
4. The individual sees his/her activities in terms of purpose. This method of viewing an individual's activities is highly valued by the members of the industry or organization. Purpose ties the individual to the organization, and the organization to the environment.

The following are characteristics of a highly ethical organization or industry:

1. There exists a clear vision and picture of integrity throughout the industry.
2. The vision is owned and embodied by top management in the industry, over time.
3. The reward system is aligned with the vision of integrity.
4. Policies and practices of the industry are aligned with the vision; no mixed messages.
5. It is understood that every significant decision has ethical value dimensions.
6. Everyone in the industry is expected to work through conflicting value perspectives.

#### The Benefit of Applying Ethics

There are many obvious moral benefits to adhering to ethical standards, but there are other benefits of ensuring that ethics are followed in the industry and in the workplace:

Attention to business ethics has substantially improved society.

A number of decades ago, children in our country worked 16-hour days. Workers' limbs were literally torn off, and disabled workers were condemned to poverty and often starvation. Conglomerates controlled some markets to ensure that prices were fixed and small businesses were choked out. Price-fixing crippled normal market forces. Employees were terminated based upon personalities. Influence was applied through intimidation and harassment.

Then society reacted and demanded that businesses place a higher value on fairness and equal rights. Antitrust laws were instituted. Government agencies were established. Unions were organized. Laws and regulations were established. Ethics programs help to maintain a moral course in turbulent times.

Attention to business ethics is critical during times of fundamental change. At such times, there is often no clear moral compass to guide leaders through complex conflicts about what is right or wrong.

Continuing attention to ethics in the workplace sensitizes leaders and staff to acting consistently.

Ethical standards support individual growth.

> Attention to ethics in the industry helps an agent to face realities, both good and bad, in the industry and within himself. In this regard, an agent may feel full of confidence and can admit and deal with whatever comes his way.

Ethics programs are a form of insurance; they help to ensure that policies and practices are legal and can stand the test of public or shareholder scrutiny.

> There is an increasing number of lawsuits in regard to the effects of products and services on the consumer. Attention to ethics ensures highly ethical policies and procedures in the workplace. Analysts believe that it is far better to incur the cost of mechanisms to ensure ethical practices now, rather than to incur the costs of litigation later.

Ethical standards help to avoid criminal acts of omission and can lower fines.

> Ethics standards, such as an insurance agent's code of ethics, tend to detect ethical issues and violations early on, so they can be addressed. In some cases, when an organization is aware of an actual or potential violation and does not report it to the appropriate authorities, it can be considered a criminal act.

Ethical guidelines adopted on an industry-wide basis potentially decrease fines if an organization or individual has clearly made an effort to operate ethically.

Ethical standards help to manage values.

> Ethics programs identify preferred values and ensure that the individual's behavior is aligned with those values. This effort includes recording the values, developing policies and procedures to align behavior with preferred standards, and then training personnel about the policies and procedures. Ethical standards are highly useful for managing strategies, such as expanding market shares, reducing costs, and managing diversity.

Ethical standards promote a strong public image.

> Attention to ethics is also a strong public relations tool. Admittedly, managing ethics should not be done primarily to enhance public relations. But the fact that an organization regularly gives attention to ethics can portray a strong, positive image to the public.
> 
> People see those organizations as valuing people more than profit, as striving to operate with the utmost integrity and honor. Aligning behavior with values is critical to effective marketing and public relations programs.

Here's the bottom line: Applying ethical standards legitimizes managerial actions, strengthens the coherence and balance of the industry, improves trust in the relationship between individuals and groups, and supports greater consistency in the standards and qualities of products.

#### Ethics and its Fundamentals

Ethics is defined as principles of moral conduct. For the insurance industry, as in many others, the basis of a business relationship is the ethical dispensation of the terms of the contract. In view of the special agent-client relationship, the following aspects of ethics are the following:

- Honesty
- Integrity
- Fairness
- Fidelity and loyalty
- Compassion
- Personal responsibility and accountability

Where there are moral considerations for employing the highest ethical standards in business dealings, there are also other considerations that reflect on the well-being and reputation of the agent. A few of them are itemized as follows:

- Social responsibility towards the community at large, including carriers
- Avoidance of public criticism. This has a direct bearing upon the volume and type of business that can be generated.
- Avoidance of government regulations.
- Minimization of errors and omissions exposures.

##### Legal Responsibility and its Basis

Ethical and professional responsibility is the basis for laws, and this creates the basis for legal responsibilities. Legal duties are based on the following:

- Peer Standards;
- Oral or written agreements; and
- Statutes.

##### Duties of an Agent to the Insurer

The legal duties of an agent, which are born out of ethical and professional responsibilities to his or her insurance company, follow the four segments as outlined below:

1. Act within authority
2. Provide full disclosure
3. Account for property and money
4. Follow instructions

##### Duties of an Agent to the Client

The following are the duties of an agent to his or her client:

- Provide adequate coverage.
- Provide proper legal notification.
- Place business on the best possible terms for the client.
- Investigate carrier stability.
- Give correct coverage options related to the insurance.
- Other—as determined by the courts

You might have a system of notifying direct-bill clients of cancellation notices for nonpayment of premiums. This is acceptable—but expensive—and may give rise to a potential E&O problem if the agency misses calling a customer. To safely cease this practice once it is established, notify all insureds that you will no longer be following up on cancellation notices for nonpayment of premium.

##### Agency Ethical Considerations

The following are an agency's ethical considerations:

1. Fiduciary duties
2. Commingling of funds – trust account
3. Payment and acceptance of commissions and fees
4. Unfair claims practices
5. Conflict of Interest
6. Unfair methods of competition and deceptive practices
7.
