### 1. Superintendent's General Duties and Powers

The Superintendent of Financial Services (Superintendent) is appointed by the Governor, and continues in office until the end of the Governor's term. The Superintendent has very broad powers, both expressed and implied with the business of insurance, that extend to all financial service providers.

First and foremost, the Superintendent has the power and authority to **recommend, withdraw, or amend regulations** for the following purposes:

- To regulate the internal affairs of the Department of Financial Services (Department), including governing the procedures used in the practice of the Department;
- To prescribe forms and regulations; and
- To interpret state insurance laws and provisions.

The Superintendent has the authority to take action deemed appropriate to ensure the following:

- Economic development and financial industry growth in this state;
- Solvency, safety, and prudent conduct of the insurance and financial services providers;
- Fair and timely fulfillment of the financial obligations;
- High standards of honesty, transparency, and fair business practices;
- Elimination of financial fraud, criminal abuse, and unethical conduct in the industry;
- Education of product users to enable them to make informed decisions about financial products and services.

If a person has been charged with **5 separate** civil penalties within **5 years**, the Superintendent may levy an additional penalty of up to $50,000. An additional civil penalty of up to $50,000 may be levied if the person is charged for every 5 subsequent violations.

When the Superintendent grants an approval, authorization, permission or any other order that affects an insurer, insurance agent or insurance broker, the order will not be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the Superintendent.

The notice will be considered delivered if it

- Is given to the person affected by the order; or
- Has been placed in the United States mail and addressed to the person's last-known place of either business or residence.

#### Examination of Books and Records

The Superintendent may examine the books and records of any insurer, any pension fund, retirement system or organization authorized in the state of New York, as often as deemed necessary, for the protection of public interest.

The Superintendent will make an examination of insurers as follows:

- Every domestic fraternal benefit society and domestic **property/casualty** insurance company, at least once every **3 years**. If the Superintendent determines that every 3 years is not necessary for property and casualty, it can be changed to every 5 years;
- Every domestic **life insurer** must be examined at least once every **5 years;**
- Every other authorized domestic insurer and every rate service organization which makes or files rates at least once in every **5 years**.

Unless otherwise required by law or regulation, an insurer must keep the following for **6 years**, or until the filing of a review of the record, whichever is longer:

- A policy record for each insurance contract or policy (the time starts after the contract or policy is no longer in force);
- An application where no policy or contract was issued;
- A claim file (the time starts after the claim is resolved and the file is closed);
- A licensing record for each licensee with which the insurer establishes a relationship; 
- A complaint record (the time starts after the complaint is resolved and the file is closed);
- A financial record necessary to verify the financial condition of an insurer.

If any person does not submit the requested information within 15 days, the Superintendent may levy a civil penalty of up to $500 per day for each day beyond the specified date. Total penalty cannot exceed $10,000.

### 2. Company Regulation

#### Certificate of Authority

No person, firm, association, corporation or joint-stock company may conduct insurance business unless authorized by a Certificate of Authority, issued by the state. If any business is transacted while not authorized, a penalty of $1,000 will be levied on the first violation and $2,500 for each subsequent violation.

In order to qualify for a certificate of authority, every person, firm, association, corporation or joint-stock company must meet the following requirements:

- The entity must fully comply with all applicable provisions of New York's insurance laws.
    
- If a stock company, the amount of capital and surplus required by law paid in cash or investments.
    
- If a mutual company, must provide statements of at least 3 incorporators, proof of the required initial surplus in cash or investments, and the required number and amount of bona fide (actual) applications for insurance, with premiums paid for in cash.
    

Every license must contain the following information:

- The name of the licensee;
    
- Home office address;
    
- The state or country under whose laws it was organized; and
    
- The kinds of insurance business it will provide and term of license.
    

After a notice and hearing, the Superintendent may refuse to issue a license to a company if any of its directors or officers has been convicted of any crime involving fraud, dishonesty, or moral turpitude (corruption, wickedness), or is considered an untrustworthy person.

The Division of Criminal Justice Services processes electronic fingerprints on a statewide basis for all individuals requiring a criminal background check. Fingerprinting is required for all adjuster, bail bond/charitable bail, and life settlement provider, intermediary, or broker licenses. Fingerprinting is also required for any person wishing to be an officer or director of an insurance company.

The Superintendent may also refuse to issue or renew a license if the business name is identical or so similar to an existing insurer name, that it is likely to deceive or mislead the public.

#### Solvency

An insurer is considered **solvent** if it has the assets to meet its financial obligations. If at any time an insurer becomes unable to meet financial obligations, it is considered insolvent.

It is the Superintendent's responsibility to make sure every insurer, fraternal, pension fund, retirement system or state fund remains solvent. Each entity transacting insurance in this state must file with the office of the Superintendent an annual statement on or before March 1st of each year showing its financial condition.

An authorized official of the insurer may verify the annual statement of an alien insurer. The statement must provide information on the business done and the assets held within the United States for the protection of policyholders and creditors, as well as the liabilities incurred against the assets.

If any authorized entity fails to file an annual statement as required or does not reply to a written inquiry within 30 days, there can be a penalty of up to $250 per day of delay, not to exceed an aggregate of $25,000 for each failure.

##### Guaranty Association

Guaranty Associations are formed to protect policyowners, insureds, beneficiaries, and anyone entitled to payment under an insurance policy from the incompetence and insolvency of insurers. The association will pay covered claims up to certain limits set by state law. The Association is funded by its members through assessment. All authorized insurers must be members of the Association as a condition of their authority to transact insurance in this state.  

It is an **unfair trade practice** to make any statement that an insurer’s policies are guaranteed by the existence of the Insurance Guaranty Association. 

Know This

Insurers _cannot advertise protection_ by the Insurance Guaranty Association.

#### Unfair Claims Settlement Practices

The following are improper claims practices if committed in conscious disregard for the law or if committed with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice to engage in that type of conduct:

- Misrepresenting to insureds pertinent facts or policy provisions relating to coverages at issue.
    
- Failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to an insurance claim.
    
- Failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for prompt investigation and processing of insured’s claims.
    
- Failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss statements are completed and submitted by insureds.
    
- Not attempting in good faith to effect prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims on which liability has become reasonably clear.
    
- Compelling insureds to initiate suits to recover amounts due under an insurance policy by offering substantially less than the amount ultimately recovered in those suits.
    

#### Appointment of Agent

Every insurer, fraternal benefit society or HMO doing business in New York must file a certificate of appointment for its agents with the Superintendent. The certificate states that the appointed agent is trustworthy and competent to transact insurance business.

To appoint an agent, the appointing insurer must file, in a format approved by the Superintendent, a notice of appointment within **15 days** from the date the agency contract is executed or the first insurance application is submitted.

Certificates of appointment are valid until

- The license is terminated by the appointing insurer after a termination in accordance with the provisions of the agency contract;
    
- The license is suspended or revoked by the Superintendent; or
    
- The license expires and is not renewed.
    

##### Termination of Agent Appointment

When an insurer or HMO terminates an agent's certificate of appointment, it must file a statement with the Superintendent within **30 days**, explaining the cause of the termination and facts surrounding it. The insurer or HMO must also provide a copy of this notice to the producer within **15 days** of the date of filing with the Superintendent.

### 3. Licensee Regulation

#### Controlled Business

**Controlled business** is any coverage written on a producer's own life, health, or property, and/or that of the producer's immediate family or business associates. A licensee is not allowed to collect commissions on controlled business above the state-specified limit. Most states will not issue a license to a person if it is determined that the primary purpose of the license is to write controlled business.

The Superintendent may refuse to issue, suspend or revoke a license if an applicant or licensee receives more than 10% of the aggregate commissions during a 12-month period from controlled business.

#### Sharing Commissions

An insurer or fraternal benefit society may not pay any commission to any person or organization that is not licensed in New York. Commissions can be split among agents/brokers provided that the agents/brokers are licensed with the same insurer for the designated lines of authority.

#### Fiduciary Responsibility

Agents, brokers and reinsurance intermediaries have a fiduciary relationship, a **position of financial trust**, for all funds they receive in the course of their business. Such funds may not be commingled with personal or other funds without express written consent of their principals.

Premiums collected by agents and brokers not remitted immediately to insurers must be deposited in an appropriately identified account in a New York bank. Withdrawals from these accounts are allowed only to transfer premiums to the rightful insurers. Failure to submit funds appropriately could constitute **embezzlement.**

#### License Display

The establishing agent or broker must prominently display the license(s) of the supervising person(s) responsible for that place of business in a headquarters location and each satellite office.

#### Commissions and Compensation

Insurers and agents cannot pay a commission or provide compensation to a person or organization that is not licensed in New York. In addition, agents, brokers, consultants, surplus line brokers, reinsurance intermediaries and adjusters cannot pay any commission to or compensate any person who is not licensed and authorized in the same lines of insurance at the time of the transaction.

No licensed person may charge directly or indirectly any additional fees or compensation **not authorized** for examining, appraising, reviewing or evaluating any insurance policy, annuity or retirement plan. This also includes other services in connection with a life insurance contract. If compensation is authorized, it must be made in writing, including the amount of compensation and signed by the person to be charged. A copy of this record must be kept for at least 3 years.

#### Termination Responsibilities of Producer

After producers receive the notice of termination, they have **30 days** to file written comments concerning the content of the notice with the Superintendent. The producer must send a copy of the comments to the reporting insurer at the same time. These comments will become part of the Superintendent's file and will accompany every copy of a report distributed or disclosed about the producer.

In the absence of fraud, bad faith or gross negligence as the cause for the producer’s termination, the terminated producer will not be subject to civil liability.

#### Reporting

Any licensee who believes that a fraudulent insurance transaction has taken place or is about to take place has **30 days** from the point of that determination to submit information regarding that transaction to the Superintendent. The Superintendent will review each report and conduct further investigation as deemed necessary.

### 4. Disciplinary Actions

#### Hearings

Because the Superintendent's role is to enforce insurance laws and to protect the public from unfair trade practices, if the Superintendent suspects that an insurer or its agent has committed a violation or is engaged in an unfair trade practice, the Superintendent may issue a statement of charges and hold a hearing for any purpose deemed necessary (within the scope of the Insurance Code).

The hearing will be held at least **10 days after notice is served**. At the hearing, the aggrieved party has the opportunity to:

- Appear in person and by counsel;
    
- Give evidence why an order should not be made;
    
- Inspect all documentary evidence and witnesses;
    
- Obtain witnesses on the person's behalf.
    

All hearings will be open to the public, unless the Superintendent or the person authorized by the Superintendent to conduct the hearing believes that a private hearing would be in the best interest of the public.

After the hearing, the Superintendent will complete a written report on the findings and send a copy to the person charged.

Once it has been determined that a person is liable for a civil penalty, that determination may be entered **120 days** later as a judgment and enforced, without court proceedings.

#### Cease and Desist Order

If the Superintendent finds that the licensee is in violation of an unfair method of competition, unfair claim, or unfair act or practice, the Superintendent will issue a **cease and desist order.** This means the person must stop doing whatever the Superintendent suspects is in violation of the insurance laws.

A person who violated a cease and desist order is liable for penalties of up to **$5,000** for each violation. The determination of the amount will take into consideration whether the violation was intentional.

#### Suspension, Revocation, and Nonrenewal

The Superintendent may refuse to renew, revoke, or suspend a license of any insurance producer, insurance consultant or adjuster, if, after notice and hearing, the Superintendent determines that the licensee or any sub-licensee has done any of the following:  

- Violated any insurance laws or regulation, subpoena, or order of the Superintendent or of another state's Commissioner;
- Provided materially incorrect, misleading, incomplete, or untrue information in the license application;
- Obtained or attempted to obtain a license through misrepresentation or fraud;
- Used fraudulent, coercive, or dishonest practices;
- Demonstrated incompetence, untrustworthiness or financial irresponsibility in the conduct of business in this state or elsewhere;
- Improperly withheld, misappropriated or converted any monies or properties received in the course of business;
- Intentionally misrepresented the terms of an actual or proposed insurance contract or application for insurance;
- Been convicted of a felony;
- Admitted or been found to have committed any insurance unfair trade practice or fraud;
- Had an insurance producer license, or its equivalent, denied, suspended or revoked in any other state, province, district or territory;
- Forged another's name to an application for insurance or to any document related to an insurance transaction;
- Improperly used notes or any other reference material to complete an examination for an insurance license;
- Knowingly accepted insurance business from an individual who is not licensed;
- Failed to comply with an administrative or court order imposing a child support obligation; or
- Failed to pay state income tax or comply with any administrative or court order directing payment of state income tax.

An individual, corporation, firm or association whose license has been revoked cannot obtain any license for a period of **1 year after such revocation**, or, if such revocation be judicially reviewed, for 1 year after the final judgment.

If a firm loses its license, a member, officer or director of the corporation may be able to obtain a license if the Superintendent determines, after notice and hearing, that the person was not at fault.

If a nonresident producer's license is suspended, revoked, or nonrenewed in the producer's resident state, the license will also be suspended, revoked, or nonrenewed in New York. Reinstatement in the producer's home state means reinstatement in New York.

If an administrative action has been taken against a licensee, the licensee must report it to the Superintendent within **30 days**.

The Superintendent will give a written reason of action to the applicant or licensee. The applicant or licensee has **10 days** to make a demand for a hearing.

#### Penalties

If the licensee is found in violation of **insurance licensing laws**, the Superintendent may issue a penalty in lieu of revoking or suspending the person's license. The penalty may be up to $500 for each offense, up to $2,500 aggregate for all offenses.

Unless the court orders a stay, the licensee has **20 days** after receipt to pay the penalty. If the licensee fails to pay the penalty within the allotted time, the Superintendent may then revoke or suspend the person's license.

Any violation of the **Insurance Code provisions** will be considered a **misdemeanor** unless specifically categorized as a felony.

If, after a notice and hearing, the Superintendent finds that an authorized insurer, representative, broker or adjuster has willfully violated the Insurance Code, the Superintendent may order the person to pay a penalty of up to $1,000 for each offense. Failure to pay the penalty within **30 days** of the order will constitute a further violation of the provision of the Code. However, no penalty will be imposed if a monetary penalty is otherwise provided by the New York Insurance Code.

#### Prohibitions

In addition to any criminal liability, the Superintendent may levy a **civil penalty** of up to $5,000 and the amount of the claim for each violation upon any person who committed a **fraudulent insurance** act, or knowingly and with intent to defraud, files, makes, or assists, solicits or conspires with another to file or make an application for a premium reduction containing any materially false information or that conceals information concerning any material fact.

#### Aiding Unauthorized Insurer

Neither a person nor a corporation may act as an agent or broker for an insurer that is not licensed to solicit, negotiate or effect any insurance or annuity contract, or aid any such insurer in effecting any insurance transactions. Note that the law allows for some exceptions for reinsurance brokers.

Any person who violates this regulation may be subject to a $500 penalty for each transaction, in addition to any other penalties provided by the state law.

### 5. Unfair and Prohibited Practices

Insurers and insurance producers may not engage in any trade practice that is defined as, or determined to be, an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance.

It is considered an unfair trade practice to knowingly engage in an unfair method of competition with enough frequency that the commission of unfair marketing practices indicates a general business practice.

If, after a hearing, the Department determines that a producer or an insurer has committed an unfair trade or competition practice, the Department may issue an order requiring the person to cease and desist from engaging in the method of competition, act, or practice, and/or impose penalties for violation of insurance laws.

#### Misrepresentation

It is illegal to issue, publish or circulate any illustration or sales material that is false, misleading or deceptive as to policy benefits or terms, benefits, advantages, the payment of dividends, or the financial condition of any insurer. This regulation also applies to oral statements made by an insurer or its producers and representatives.

It is illegal for an agent or broker to show an incomplete comparison of policies to induce a person to lapse, forfeit or surrender a policy.

Any agent or broker who willingly commits misrepresentation and knowingly receives any compensation or commission for the sale induced by a misrepresentation is liable for a **civil penalty** in the amount received. In addition, the agent/broker is liable for a civil penalty in the amount of any compensation or commission lost by any agent, representative, or broker as a result of making false or misleading statements. Any person so offended may also sue the agent/broker for the amount gained and penalty paid during the misrepresentation.

It is considered an unfair trade practice in this state to knowingly misrepresent to a claimant the terms, benefits and advantages of the insurance policy pertinent to the claim. Insurers cannot deny any element of a claim on the grounds of a specific policy provision or exclusion unless reference to such provision or exclusion is made in writing. Any payment or settlement that does not include all the amounts reasonably expected from the claim will be deemed to be a communication which misrepresents a pertinent policy provision (as long as the claim payment is within the policy limits).

While the concept of misrepresentation during policy replacement applies specifically to life insurance and annuities, all agents and brokers (regardless of their line of authority) must be aware of and in compliance with this regulation. Any replacement of individual life policies or individual annuity contracts of an insurer by an agent, representative of the same or different insurer must conform to the following standards implemented by the Superintendent:

- Specify what constitutes the replacement of a life policy or annuity contract and the proper disclosure and notification procedures to replace a policy or contract;
    
- Require notification of the proposed replacement to the insurer whose policies or contracts are intended to be replaced;
    
- Require the timely exchange of illustrative and cost information necessary for completion of a comparison of the proposed and replaced coverage; and
    
- Provide for a 60-day period following issuance of the replacement policies or contracts during which the policyowner may return the policies or contracts and reinstate the replaced policies or contracts.
    

#### False Advertising

Advertising covers a wide scope of communication, from publishing an ad in a newspaper or magazine, to broadcasting a commercial on television or the Internet. Advertisements cannot include any untrue, deceptive, or misleading statements that apply to the business of insurance or anyone who conducts it. The violation of this rule is called **false advertising.**

It is prohibited to advertise or circulate any materials that are untrue, deceptive, or misleading. False or deceptive advertising specifically includes **misrepresenting** any of the following:

- Terms, benefits, conditions, or advantages of any insurance policy;
    
- Any dividends to be received from the policy, or previously paid out;
    
- Financial condition of any person or the insurance company; or
    
- The true purpose of an assignment or loan against a policy.

Representing an insurance policy as a share of stock, or using names or titles that may misrepresent the true nature of a policy also will be considered false advertising. In addition, a person or an entity cannot use a name that deceptively suggests it is an insurer.

#### Rebating

Rebating is defined as any inducement offered in the sale of insurance products that is **not specified** in the policy. It is illegal to offer an inducement to a person to encourage the purchase of an insurance policy. Rebates include money, sharing of commissions, promises, inducements and personal services. Both the offer and acceptance of a rebate are illegal.

Articles of merchandise with a conspicuously stamped or printed advertisement of the insurer, agent or broker, are not considered rebates if they are valued at **$25 or less**.

#### Defamation of Insurer

**Defamation** occurs when an oral or written statement is made that is intended to injure a person engaged in the insurance business. This also applies to statements that are **maliciously critical** of the _financial condition_ of any person or a company.

#### Unfair Discrimination

**Discrimination** in rates, premiums, or policy benefits for persons within the **same class** or with the same life expectancy is illegal. No discrimination may be made on the basis of an individual's marital status, race, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, creed, or ancestry unless the distinction is made for a business purpose or required by law.

### 6. Insurance Frauds Prevention Act

The **Insurance Frauds Prevention Act** is intended to permit the Superintendent and the department to utilize their expertise to investigate and discover insurance frauds, halt fraudulent activities more effectively, and receive assistance from federal and state law enforcement agencies.

#### Insurance Frauds Bureau

The Insurance Frauds Bureau in the Department continues its operations under the supervision of the Superintendent, who has the power to designate one or more units for the purpose of investigating and preventing fraud.

#### Procedures

If the insurance frauds bureau has reason to believe that a person is engaged or is about to engage in a fraudulent act, it has **30 days** to make a report on the action, including any information relating to the circumstances and the parties involved.

The Superintendent has the power to make an investigation within this state or outside of the state.

#### Immunity

As long as the suspected fraudulent transaction was reported in good faith, no civil liability will be placed against the person who reported it.

#### Fraud Prevention Plans and Special Investigations Units

Every insurer writing private or commercial insurance must file a fraud prevention plan for the detection, investigation and prevention of fraudulent insurance activities within 120 days. The plan must include the details necessary for the proper implementation of the plan.

The following rules apply to the implementation of the plan:

- If the Superintendent does not return a fraud detection and prevention plan to the insurer within 120 days from the date of filing, it is considered approved.
    
- If the plan is returned, the insurer has up to 45 days to make the necessary revisions and return to the Superintendent.
    
- If the plan has been returned more than once, the insurer is entitled to a hearing.
    
- If the insurer fails to submit a final plan within 30 days after the determination of the hearing, the Superintendent may impose a fine of up to $2,000 per day or impose an appropriate fraud detection and prevention plan.

In lieu of a special investigations unit within the insurance company, an insurer may contract an outside company to provide the investigative services. This insurer must also file a detailed plan with the Superintendent.

### 7. Consumer Privacy Regulation

Treatment of nonpublic personal financial information about individuals requires the insurer to

- Provide notice to individuals about its privacy policies and practices, **no later** **than the time an insurance policy is delivered**, annually thereafter. If information is collected from a source other than the applicant or public records, notice must be given at the time the information is collected.
- Describe the conditions under which a licensee may disclose nonpublic personal financial information about individuals to affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties. **If the insured requests or authorizes** a transaction in connection with servicing, processing or maintaining of an insurance product, the insurer is exempt from the requirements of disclosure.
- Provide methods for individuals to prevent a licensee from disclosing that information. An **_opt out_ notice must be provided,** to allow the consumer a choice to limit disclosure of personal information.

### 8. Producer Compensation Transparency

The regulation on Producer Compensation Transparency was promulgated to help regulate the acts and practices of insurers and their producers, as well as to protect the public by establishing minimum disclosure requirements regarding the role of insurance producers and their compensation.

For the purposes of this regulation, the term _compensation_ means anything of value, which includes, but it not limited to money, credits, loans, trips, prizes or gifts, whether paid as commission or otherwise. Advertisement or promotional goods with the insurer's name or logo are not considered compensation, as long as their aggregate value per insurer per year is less than $100.

This regulation **does not apply** to the following:

- Placement of reinsurance;
- Placement of insurance with a captive insurer;
- Producers who have no direct sales or solicitation contact with the purchasers;
- Sale of insurance by a person who is not required to be licensed; or
- Renewals.

#### Disclosure of Producer Compensation

A disclosure of producer compensation must include the following information:

- A description of the producer's role in the transaction;
- Whether or not the producer will receive compensation from the sales;
- An explanation of factors that affect the amount of producer compensation;
- The purchaser's right to request and obtain information about the producer's compensation.

Producers are required to keep a copy of all written disclosures provided to the purchasers for at least **3 years.**

### 9. Cyber Regulation

In an effort to combat the ever-increasing menace of hackers extracting sensitive data from companies' databases, the state of New York has instituted a new regulation outlining the minimum standards for a required cybersecurity program _(23 NYCRR 500)_.

All financial services companies must implement and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to prevent cyberattacks and recover if one occurs. Senior management must be responsible for the organization's cybersecurity program and ensure the safety and soundness of the institution and protect its customers. Regulated entities must file an **annual certification** confirming compliance with these regulations.

#### Definitions

**_Covered Entity_**_:_ any person operating under a license, registration, certificate, or similar authorization under the Banking Law, the Insurance Law, or the Financial Services Law.

**_Cybersecurity Event_**_:_ any effort to obtain unapproved access to an Information System (or information stored on it), whether successful or unsuccessful.

**_Information System_**_:_ an organized system that collects, maintains, and transmits electronic Nonpublic Information.

**_Nonpublic Information_**_:_ any business-related information that is not publicly available information that if misused could jeopardize a covered entity's security and operations; any personally identifiable information (such as **social security number or credit card numbers**); and any information (other than age and gender) related to health care.

**_Multi-Factor Authenticatio_****n**: authentication through verification of at least two factors:

1. Knowledge factor, such as a password;
2. Possession factors, such as a token or text message on a mobile phone; or
3. Inherence factors, such as a biometric characteristic.

**_Penetration Testing_** means a test method where assessors attempt to circumvent or defeat the security features of an information system by attempting to penetrate databases or controls from outside or inside the information systems.

**_Chief Information Security Officer (CISO_****):** Each covered entity must designate a qualified individual for overseeing and implementing its cybersecurity program and enforcing its cybersecurity policy.

#### Cyber Security Program

Each nongovernmental Person operating under the New York Department of Financial Services must design, implement, and maintain a Cybersecurity Plan based on its Risk Assessment that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Information Systems. The 6 critical functions of the **Cybersecurity Program** are:

1. Identify cybersecurity risks;
2. Use defensive infrastructure and put policies and procedures in place to prevent cybersecurity risks;
3. Monitor and recognize cybersecurity events;
4. Counter any attacks to reduce undesirable outcomes;
5. Recover from such events; and
6. Report the event as obligated.

The **Cybersecurity Policy** is an approved written document that identifies the policies and procedures in place to keep the Information System safe, and must encompass the following:

- Information security;
- Data governance and classification;
- Asset inventory and device management;
- Access controls and identity management;
- Business continuity and disaster recovery planning and resources;
- Systems operations and availability concerns;
- Systems and network security and monitoring;
- Systems and application development and quality assurance;
- Physical security and environmental controls;
- Customer data privacy;
- Vendor and third-party service provider management;
- Risk assessment; and
- Incident response.

Covered Entities must make sure that the nonpublic information and information systems accessible by **Third-Party Service Providers** (those who are authorized to access nonpublic information) are kept safe. To do that, the policies and procedures set forth must include the following:

- Identification and risk assessment of third-parties with access to such information;
- Minimum cybersecurity practices that must be upheld by third-party service providers;
- Processes in place to judge the effectiveness of the third-party's cybersecurity practices;
- Annual (at minimum) evaluation of third-parties and their cybersecurity practices.

#### Training and Monitoring

As part of its cybersecurity program, each Covered Entity **must**:

1. Implement risk-based policies, procedures and controls designed to monitor the activity of authorized users and detect unauthorized access or use of, or tampering with, nonpublic information by such authorized users; and
2. Provide regular cybersecurity awareness training for all personnel that is updated to reflect risks identified by the covered entity in its risk assessment.

After a cybersecurity event has been discovered, an insurer or its agents **must report the event** to the Department of Financial Services within **72 hours**.
