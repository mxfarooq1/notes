### 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act

The **Fair Credit Reporting Act** established procedures that consumer-reporting agencies must follow in order to ensure that records are confidential, accurate, relevant, and properly used. The law also **protects consumers** against the circulation of inaccurate or obsolete personal or financial information.

The acceptability of a risk is determined by checking the individual risk against many factors directly related to the risk's potential for loss. Besides these factors, an underwriter will sometimes request additional information about a particular risk from an outside source. These reports generally fall into 2 categories: Consumer Reports and Investigative Consumer Reports. Both reports can only be used by someone with a legitimate business purpose, including insurance underwriting, employment screening, and credit transactions.

**Consumer reports** include written and/or oral information regarding a consumer's credit, character, reputation, or habits collected by a reporting agency from employment records, credit reports, and other public sources.

**Investigative Consumer Reports** are similar to consumer reports in that they also provide information on the consumer's character, reputation, and habits. The primary _difference_ is that the information is obtained through an investigation and interviews with associates, friends and neighbors of the consumer. Unlike consumer reports, these reports cannot be made unless the consumer is advised in writing about the report within **3 days** of the date the report was requested. The consumers must be advised that they have a right to request additional information concerning the report, and the insurer or reporting agency has **5 days** to provide the consumer with the additional information.

Know This

Insurance applicants must be notified in writing whenever insurers request investigative consumer reports.

The reporting agency and users of the information are subject to civil action for failure to comply with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. A person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses may also be fined and/or imprisoned for up to 2 years.

An individual who **unknowingly** violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act is liable in the amount equal to the loss to the consumer, as well as any reasonable attorney fees incurred in the process.

An individual who **willfully** violates this Act enough to constitute a general pattern or business practice will be subject to a penalty of up to $2,500.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if a policy of insurance is declined or modified because of information contained in either a consumer or investigative report, the consumer must be advised and provided with the name and address of the reporting agency. **The** **consumer has the right to know what was in the report**. The consumer also has a right to know the identity of anyone who has received a copy of the report during the past year. If the consumer challenges any of the information in the report, the reporting agency is required to reinvestigate and amend the report, if warranted. If a report is found to be inaccurate and is corrected, the agency must send the corrected information to all parties to which they had reported the inaccurate information within the last 2 years.

Consumer reports cannot contain certain types of information if the report is requested in connection with a life insurance policy or credit transaction of less than $150,000. The **prohibited information** includes bankruptcies more than 10 years old, civil suits, records of arrest or convictions of crimes, or any other negative information that is more than 7 years old. As defined by the Act, _negative information_ includes information regarding a customer's delinquencies, late payments, insolvency or any other form of default.

### 2. Fraud and False Statements including 1033 Waiver

It is considered **unlawful insurance fraud** for any person engaged in the business of insurance to willfully, and with the intent to deceive, make any oral or written statement that is either false or that omits material facts. This includes information and statements made on an application for insurance, renewal of a policy, claims for payment or benefits, premiums paid, and financial condition of an insurer.

Anyone engaged in the business of insurance whose activities affect interstate commerce, and who knowingly makes false material statements may be fined, imprisoned for up to **10 years** or both. If the activity jeopardized the security of the accompanied insurer, the punishment can be up to **15 years**.

Anyone acting as an officer, director, agent, or other insurance employee who is convicted of embezzling funds faces fines and imprisonment. However, if the embezzlement was in an amount less than **$5,000**, prison time may be reduced to 1 year.

Federal law makes it illegal for any individual convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, breach of trust or a violation of the **Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994** to work in the business of insurance affecting interstate commerce without receiving a **letter of** **written consent** from an insurance regulatory official — a **1033 waiver**. The consent of the official must specify that it is granted for the purpose of 18 U.S.C. 1033. Anyone convicted of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust, who also engages in the business of insurance, will be fined, imprisoned for up to 5 years or both.

Section 1034, Civil Penalties and Injunctions for Violations of Section 1033, states that the Attorney General may bring a **civil action** in the appropriate U.S. district court against any person who engages in conduct that is in violation of Section 1033 of not more than **$50,000** for each violation, or the amount of compensation the person received as a result of the prohibited conduct, whichever is greater.
